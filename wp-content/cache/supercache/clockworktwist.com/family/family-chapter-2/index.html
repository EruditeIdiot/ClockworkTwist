		<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Twist felt the airship begin to descend under his feet, deeper into the hot, dry, scorching air. The bow was aiming at a distant mountain of rock that stood in the sandy desert like an island in a golden sea. It took nearly half an hour for the airship to draw close enough for Twist to begin to make out orchards of fruit trees standing proud in the more fertile land that surrounded a thin, shimmering, river-like oasis just before the foothills of the mountain. A small town nestled around the water as well, like a distant echo of London around the snaking Thames.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Myra came to join Twist and Jonas on deck, watching for the coming town and the approaching storm. Twist was grateful that Myra hadn’t heard of the town of Tamarasset, as it prompted Jonas to answer his own unspoken questions as well. It seemed that the town was a well-known outpost of sorts, where travelers frequently stopped while crossing the Sahara, both by air and by land. Because of this constant business, the town had grown to accommodate airship travelers in particular and boasted a surprising number of repair and supply shops to cater to them. It was therefore the perfect place to repair the <i>Vimana</i>, sandstorm or no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking up toward the storm that had recently appeared at the very edge of the horizon, Twist was shocked to find the long, tall, billowing wall of gray-gold cloud now drawing quite near. He could see nothing at all through the thick mass of dust and sand, but he could clearly see it moving ever closer, much more quickly than he’d expected it to. The <i>Vimana</i> passed over the town and flew closer to the mountain, where Twist noticed a large opening in one side of the tall, solitary, starkly vertical peak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">As the <i>Vimana</i> glided closer to the opening, Twist saw dozens of airships of different sizes and designs clustered tightly together inside the shaded cavern, nearly filling the mountain peak. More airships were just docking as well, while the <i>Vimana</i> moved slowly, slipping into an empty space, as Twist began to hear a distant roar of wind coming from the desert behind them. Soon after, they docked, and while the <i>Vimana</i>’s crew and passengers readied to leave the airship, Twist saw a huge, heavy tarp of thick fabric fall slowly to cover the opening in the mountain, effectively sealing off the airship docks.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Are they trapping us in here?” Twist asked Jonas with a frown.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">They have to,” Jonas responded. “Once the storm hits, the air outside will be filled with dust and sand, and it’ll be impossible to see or even breathe without protection. And the storm will wreck anything that’s not covered. This way, the airships will be safe.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Good heavens,” Twist muttered, suddenly growing more nervous about the coming storm.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Are we all heading into the city, then?” Howell asked, looking over the airship’s entire crew and all of her passengers, who had now gathered on the deck.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">I mean no offense to your ship, of course,” Harman, the older gypsy, said with a weary smile to Howell, “but I’ll take any excuse to put my feet back on solid ground.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Beside him, Harman’s son, Luca, smiled at his father understandingly. The two Frenchmen who had come to Philippe’s aid in Sierra Leone—who Twist still hadn’t managed to learn the names of and still called Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in his mind—seemed less desperate to step off the airship but stood ready with the <i>Vimana</i>’s crew to depart as well, nonetheless.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">No offense taken, Harman,” Howell said to the gypsy. “We’re not all born with the soul of an aeronaut. Shall we, then?” he asked, taking the lead off of the ship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Twist, Jonas, and Myra fell into line while they and the others began to climb down the narrow metal stairway that covered most of the rock walls, while the crews and passengers from other docked airships joined them in one massive line of people, all heading down to the cavern floor. Finally reaching the floor of the cavern, Twist saw men tying off ropes all along the edge of the massive tarp, securing it to the cave mouth. The fabric was billowing and fighting now, as the roaring sounds outside increased.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">What if another airship needs to come in here?” Myra asked Jonas worriedly, holding the crook of Twist’s arm as the three of them walked together.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">The storm is too close now,” Jonas said with a shrug. “If there’s anyone else still out there, they’ll have to head for a coast or fly up over the storm. But anyone would have seen the storm coming, just like we did,” he offered, smiling reassuringly to her. “Sandstorms are dangerous, but this isn’t the Dark Ages. People know how to handle them. Don’t worry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Myra smiled gratefully to him. Twist silently breathed a sigh of relief at his friend’s perspective and tried to put his own anxiety out of his mind. Twist and his companions joined the crowd that moved casually toward a hallway-like opening in the rock to one side. A gentle slope took them all down to a lower, smaller cavern that may have been merely a few feet under the surface of the desert floor above and was filled with what looked very much like a train station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">A small locomotive—oddly devoid of a smokestack—stood on narrow tracks that continued on through a long tunnel, heading in the direction of the desert town Twist had seen from the air. A line of open carriages waited behind it, beside a small platform. The crowd of airship passengers climbed aboard them without hesitation, under the stark electric lights that filled the space with false daylight. Twist and his companions took seats on the simple metal benches that filled one of the open carriages. The conductor called to the remaining passengers on the small platform that the train was ready to leave, and they hurried aboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">In moments, the train began to move, but it did so slowly at first. But even with the train moving at a slow pace, Twist noticed a gentle breeze running playfully through the tunnel, and the air struck him as surprisingly fresh considering that they were underground. As if to answer his silent questions, the train soon passed under a huge set of swiftly spinning fans that were set into the ceiling. The whirring blades threw a strong gust of clean, fresh air down on the travelers, without the slightest hint of sand or dust. Twist could only assume that the air was filtered before it was forced into the tunnels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a few moments, the train began to speed up until it was nearly flying down the straight, narrow tracks. The electric lights appeared to pulse rhythmically as the train sped under them swiftly. Twist tugged his black top hat firmly onto his head to keep it from flying off, while Myra and Arabel both lifted their hands into the rushing air and giggled excitedly at the dizzy pace. It only seemed like a few moments—but a great deal of distance—before the train began to slow once again. It soon pulled into another underground station, at the edge of what looked to Twist like a city street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Square buildings made of brick and stone housed shops, restaurants, and even what looked like apartment homes, under more of the bright electric lights. A solid, vaulted ceiling of rock, standing on a forest of slender columns of rock, covered the entire area. There were open plazas with benches and fountains under more of the life-giving fans that were set into the ceiling, and even a fair few sidewalk cafes where patrons lounged on cushions and couches, sipping from small glasses and smoking long pipes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The city was also bustling with activity and filled with many different kinds of people. There was a smattering of Europeans, Asian, Africans, and others that Twist couldn’t easily identify. Most of the crowd, however, wore bright blue-and-white robe-like clothing that covered them from head to toe. While the women and the young boys and girls wore only white or blue head scarves with uncovered faces, all of the men wore turbans of blue that wrapped around their faces, revealing only their eyes.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">What a fascinating place,” Twist remarked as he and the others left the train and paused near the edge of the city. “Is this all under that little town I saw in the desert?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">We’re exactly under it,” Jonas answered, nodding. “All of the buildings you saw up above continue down into this area. This is the basement level.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Everyone comes here in a sandstorm,” Philippe mentioned in his light French accent, having stopped close beside Twist, Jonas, and Myra. “There is nowhere better in the whole of the Sahara to wait out a sandstorm than in Tamarasset.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Twist was surprised to find a warm smile on the doctor’s face as he spoke. He still looked fatigued and pale from his ordeal with the vampires earlier that week, but he seemed to be making a swift recovery nonetheless. Aazzi stood at his side, her black-gloved hand tucked in the crook of his arm, her sapphire shawl and black gown matching his stylish blue suit and black hat and waistcoat perfectly.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Have you been here before, then?” Twist asked him.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">I met my wife here,” Philippe said as he smiled, looking at Twist through his wire-rimmed silver spectacles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aazzi smiled aside, to her husband. “Just think,” she began in her rich but wistful voice, “how different our lives would have been, had I worked as a maid at a different hotel, or had you never come to his city at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Twist instantly followed her meaning: she might never have returned to her family, they might not have ever turned her into a vampire, and Philippe might never have been taken by them and nearly killed. Then, the softness in her voice caused Twist to think again. If she and Philippe had never met, then they wouldn’t have fallen in love, either. They wouldn’t be married now.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">I like to believe,” Philippe said, turning to her, “that no matter what happened in our past, I would have always found you, <i>ma cherie</i>.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aazzi’s silver eyes sparkled with a warmth that Twist rarely saw in her, but she said nothing in return. Nonetheless, Philippe seemed to accept her silent smile as a deeply positive response. Twist could only marvel at their seamless and elegant understanding of each other. No matter what obstacles and trials they faced, their love and compassion for each other was as solid as stone. He’d certainly read many similar sentiments in novels or poetry, but he couldn’t remember ever seeing it so clearly in real life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">As no one else seemed to be so moved by this subtle display as Twist was, the others turned their attentions easily away to other things. The <i>Vimana</i> needed significant repairs, and their supplies were getting frighteningly low. Thankfully, Twist and his companions had found a cache of diamonds inside the steam-powered elephant that they had used to flee from the vampires’ castle, and no one’s purse was particularly light at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Howell sent Arabel and Aazzi out to refill their supplies and took Zayle with him to search for the parts that they needed to replace. The gypsies and the Frenchmen offered to assist in the repairs, but Howell and the rest of his crew refused them all with casual smiles and mentioned that they had to wait out the storm regardless. Twist could only guess that the <i>Vimana</i>’s crew preferred to do all of the work themselves out of a feeling of protective ownership, and so didn’t press them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern declared that they intended to explore the city. Considering his weakened condition, there was no question that Philippe wouldn’t be helping with the airship either. He instead went with his two friends, almost instantly switching to using only French to speak with them in a casual air.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Well then,” Jonas said pleasantly, turning to Twist and Myra. “Who’s up for a tour? I know all the best places in the city.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Oh!” Myra gasped happily. “Yes, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Twist smiled to see her delight and nodded as well.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Thanks for inviting us too, Jonny,” Luca said to Jonas with a hint of offense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Twist looked to the two gypsies—Luca and Harman, both dressed in mismatched clothing and sporting questionable grooming choices—to find them staring at Jonas with playfully judgmental expressions.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">You already know your way around,” Jonas said with a shrug. “I’d thought you two would rather go pickpocketing or something.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Oh, yes,” Harman said with a smile, as if this were a revelation. “This place is ripe with confused tourists and heavy purses. Let’s make the best of it, shall we, son?” he asked, looking to Luca.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Good idea,” Luca agreed, putting on a wide smile. “We can’t go losing our skills to disuse, like some people,” he added with a displeased glance to Jonas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Jonas smiled and shook his head. “I’ve got to admire your family’s dedication to crime. Even if it is just petty crime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Luca shot Jonas a dangerous glare, but Jonas kept his own eyes well clear of meeting the angry gypsy’s.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Our dedication to petty crime,” Harman said warningly, “kept you fed and warm for many years, Jonny. Don’t forget that.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Of course, I haven’t,” Jonas responded innocently. “I’m only trying to annoy Luca, after all. I mean no disrespect to you, Harman.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Harman shrugged, his smile returning.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Snooty, suck-up pirate,” Luca grumbled.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">At your service, sir,” Jonas said with an exaggerated bow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Luca gave a noisy huff and crossed his arms.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Come along, Luca,” Harman said with a light chuckle. “We can’t keep our new purses waiting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Luca gave one last glare at Jonas but not another word of protest, and the two gypsies vanished into the crowd with adept skill. The moment they were out of earshot, however, Jonas let out a fatigued-sounding sigh.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Jonas?” Myra asked, looking to him with hesitant curiosity. “If you don’t mind my asking, are you and Luca actually friends or not?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">I’m sorry?” Jonas asked back, clearly confused.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Well…” Myra muttered, her soft anxiety chilling Twist’s Sight through her gentle touch on his arm. “You just seem to fight an awful lot. Not the way you fight with Twist, I mean,” she added swiftly with a smile. “It’s not even the same way you fight with Vane. With Luca, it looks like real fighting. I just wonder if he’s done something to offend you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Twist looked to her with a surprised smile, her silent understanding of things that he would find frightfully complex amazing him once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Jonas smiled at Myra. “Thank you for your concern, poppet. Luca and I grew up together. We’re family. We don’t have to like each other all the time.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">That doesn’t sound very nice,” Myra said, concerned. “Having to live with people you don’t like.”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">I don’t know,” Jonas said with a casual shrug. “I find it easier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Myra didn’t seem convinced by this but shrugged nonetheless.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">Meanwhile,” Jonas said brightly, “I really do know all the best places in this city. I’ve passed through here more than once in my travels. Shall we be off?”</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-size: medium;">By all means,” Twist said with a smile and a nod. “Lead on, Magellan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Jonas shot him a look for the sarcasm but made no complaint at the title.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">In moments, the three of them plunged into the city together, and Jonas clearly seemed to enjoy being able to show his detailed knowledge of the place with a casual ease. He took them to a busy and colorful bazaar, not unlike the one Twist had seen in Bombay. They walked by restaurants and cafes, while Jonas mentioned the specialties of each and which to avoid. Jonas pointed out a large square near the center of the city, where he said there were often impromptu concerts by local musicians, and indicated to Twist and Myra which of the many hotels they saw had the softest beds and the best room service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">While they ambled about, Twist quietly savored the brightness that murmured in the buzz at his neck: the constant connection to the mood of Jonas’s spirit. Jonas wasn’t often so at ease, and the feeling was refreshing to Twist after all of the anxiety and fear that they had both endured over the last few days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Myra’s spirit also felt light and happy in his Sight, her emotions bleeding comfortably into his mind while she held his arm as they strolled together. When they walked under a particularly close electric light, a gleaming flash caught Twist’s attention. He glanced down to her left hand, which rested gently in the crook of his arm, and his gaze fell onto the diamond ring on her finger. His heart beat quicker as a sudden flash of nervous excitement shot through him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">He looked up to her beautiful, gleaming, copper clockwork face as she smiled while listening to Jonas speak. Despite all logic, this flawless and breathtaking young woman had agreed to be his wife. Twist couldn’t imagine that he was capable of loving her more than he already did.</span></p>
