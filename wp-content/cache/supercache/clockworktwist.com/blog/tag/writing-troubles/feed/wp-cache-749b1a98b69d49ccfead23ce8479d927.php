										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling to finish the first draft of the 11th book in the Clockwork Twist series for almost a year now.  I finished the draft of the 10th book in a record 6 weeks, but each of the rest of the books took 4 months or less.  But this one&hellip;  And it&rsquo;s not that I have nothing to say.  The plot is solid, the threads are all coming together, right now the word count is well over my target, but the details keep shifting.  And every time they shift, I have to go back and follow the ripples, and rewrite what I&rsquo;ve already done.  Again, and again, and again.  I&rsquo;ve done rewrites loads of times before, but this one just doesn&rsquo;t seem to settle.</p>
<p>So, rather than let myself get tired of my Twist, I decided to have a short break.  I&rsquo;ve had an idea for another story entirely, running around my head for a while now.  It&rsquo;s not steampunk, it&rsquo;s not a silly adventure, it&rsquo;s not an escape, and it&rsquo;s not anything like what I&rsquo;ve written before.  It&rsquo;s atmospheric, emotional, and it tackles real life issues that matter to me.  It&rsquo;s also set in space, but that&rsquo;s really just the back drop.  I&rsquo;ve never actually written any of this new story because I&rsquo;ve been worried about getting off track with Twist.  But, the moment I decided to take a break, writing this new one was all I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And holy hell, this feels amazing.  It&rsquo;s all new!  I don&rsquo;t know these people!  I know the world, and I know what I want to say, but it&rsquo;s all happening now!  I can&rsquo;t wait to get to know them, and their stories, and figure out what happens.  I haven&rsquo;t felt this excited about writing since the first time I met Twist.  I so, so needed this.</p>
<p>I will get back to Twist once I&rsquo;ve had a break with this new story, but right now, I&rsquo;m on vacation on Mars.  It&rsquo;s amazing to me, how much I needed the break, and didn&rsquo;t know it.  If you&rsquo;re working on something right now that&rsquo;s just not going anywhere, I highly suggest you try working on something new.  It might be just what you need.</p>
