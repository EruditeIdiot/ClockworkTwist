										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mapoftimebook.com/" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1300487687l/9766078.jpg" width="220" height="333" /></a>I want you to take a moment, and breath in a lung-full of air.  Savor the taste of it.  Notice that it&#8217;s ordinary, clean of the ozone-spark of anything like magic.  And now that you know what you&#8217;ll be leaving behind, let me introduce you to something truly magnificent.</p>
<p>The Map of Time, by Felix J. Palma is without a doubt, the best thing I&#8217;ve ever read.  It&#8217;s not a classic (yet), it&#8217;s not Poe, or Dickens, or Wilde, and it&#8217;s certainly not flawless, but it is still the very best.  Let me attempt to explain what I mean.</p>
<p>Rather than listing all of the ways this book is exceptional, first let&#8217;s take a look at what&#8217;s wrong with it.  Palma breaks loads of literary rules.  There are more red-herrings than I can count.  He uses real, dead human beings as characters.  He makes fun of Terminator in the middle of the Victorian era.  He&#8217;s writing in Spanish, but writing exclusively about English people.  He switches POV whenever it suits him.  He smashes the 4th wall to bits so frequently that I got used to it, and made fun of his own novel, inside of his own novel!  And yet&#8230;  When he breaks these ancient rules, he does it with such grace and smug brilliance that I not only forgave him for it, but I wanted to thank him for his bravery and for proving that it could be done.</p>
<p>I fell in love with this book on the first page.  I had no idea what was in store for me (or H.G.Wells) when I read that first page, but I could smell the magic.  But it&#8217;s not just the first page.  Every character in this massive tome (I recommend the eBook simply so that the book is physically manageable) is treated with near-Vernian compassion, which gives them all a full life of their own.  The plot is revealed in endless layer upon layer, each one perfectly plausible at the time and yet obviously ridiculous once you see the next.  The actual events are dense and complexly connected, and yet there is always time to sit down with the Elephant Man for tea, and learn through sublime implications just how human he really is.  How human we all are.</p>
<p>This book is a treasure trove of delight and beauty.  There&#8217;s something wonderfully clever around every corner, and something honest, raw, and bittersweet tucking into every silence.  There were moments, when reading this, that I honestly could not put the book down (even if I was supposed to be working, or I was starting to run late for my appointment) because I felt that electric tingle in my blood that always tells you: Stop.  This is rare.  This is something worth being late for.  This, right here, is going to change your world and make it a little wider &#8230; even if just by a little.</p>
<p>I should, also, mention that there are actual flaws that I can&#8217;t exactly excuse.  There seems to be no filtering when it comes to &#8220;romance&#8221; or gruesome violence.  Although they are few, some of the scenes are so unexpectedly detailed, and yet surrounded by such charming passages, that I felt they were incongruous with the rest of the book.  And so, as much as I&#8217;d like to, I can&#8217;t recommend this book to anyone under-aged or easily offended.  I noticed many, many, typos throughout the book, probably due to the fact that it was translated from Spanish to English and is longer than Harry Potter.  And yet&#8230;  I found I could forgive Palma all of this, easily.  I guess, in this case, an overwhelming amount of good really can outweigh the bad.</p>
<p>Now, I will not tell you what this book is about.  If I did, it would spoil so many wonderful moments.  So, you&#8217;re just going to have to take my word for it.  If you&#8217;re fine with your air the way it is, then go read something else.  But, if you&#8217;re like me and you prefer your air scented with a hint of magic crackling in the corners, then I have just the book for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I realize that this isn&#8217;t the most well known Sci-Fi sub genre in the world, so here&#8217;s a crash course in Steampunk, Victoriana, and Neo-Victorian.</p>
<p><a title="wiki link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk" target="_blank">Steampunk</a> is speculative fiction, usually set between 1850 and 1900, and is mostly set in either London or the Old West.  It&#8217;s also sometimes set in a purely fictional world that is full of Victorian era details.  Jules Verne is also aprimary source for many Steampunk enthusiasts.  It&#8217;s both fantasy and Sci-fi, focusing on various occult and magical themes, mixed with misplaced technology and lots of goggles, steam power, airships, and clockwork.<a href="http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;expIds=25657,27342,28203&amp;sugexp=ldymls&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=steampunk&amp;cp=6&amp;wrapid=tljp129445160051608&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=k8MnTdP0KJKisAOc7p2kBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQsAQwAA&amp;biw=1003&amp;bih=448" target="_blank"><span id="more-29"></span></a></p>
<p>For me, Steampunk is a beautiful, exotic, and exciting style to play in.  Electricity was only just beginning to gain importance during the Victorian era, fighting with steam, coal, and analog.  Photography, film, recorded sound, world travel, electric lights, computers, the impressionists, and flight were only just beginning.  At that time in history the future could have been anything.  Add fantasy (faeries, vampires, aliens, time travel, magic,  zombies) to the mix, and of course, airship pirates!  How fun is that?</p>
<p>There are also two other terms you might hear me use on this page:<br />
Victoriana and Neo-Victorian.</p>
<p><a title="wiki link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoriana" target="_blank">Victoriana</a> is anything that was made in the Victorian era (1837 &#8211; 1901), and is indicative of the style of the time period.  For example, the book <a title="Read the book on ibiblio.org" href="http://www.ibiblio.org/julesverne/books/awed%20revd%20edn.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Around the world in 80 Days</em></a> by Jules Vern was written in 1873 and is bursting at the seems with the the flare and feelings of the world at the time.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><a title="wiki link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Victorian" target="_blank">Neo-Victorian</a>, on the other hand, is anything that has been made now but still holds to the styles, values, or aesthetic of the Victorian era.  For example, the fairly recent films <a title="IMDB link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970179/" target="_blank"><em>Hugo</em></a>, and <a title="IMDb link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988045/" target="_blank"><em>Sherlock Holmes</em></a>, or a great deal of the items for sale on <a title="Pretty!!!" href="http://www.etsy.com/search?q=steampunk&amp;view_type=gallery" target="_blank">Etsy</a> are all modern things, which look Victorian.</p>
