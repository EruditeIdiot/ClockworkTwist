<p>First of all, I&#8217;m terribly sorry that this blog has been silent for the last few weeks!  See?  Look how sad the clock is&#8230;  My nasty, broken, no-auto-posting blog is just as sad.  We had a talk.  Thing should be running smoothly again, with a weekly blog and an extra picture or two, as of now!  And if it doesn&#8217;t run smoothly, we&#8217;ll have another talk.  That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m looking at you, blog!</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 1!</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve quit my day job!  Pop those party popper, break out the music, and hand me a drink!  After trying to juggle a full-time job and a 12 part series, I finally dropped all the balls at my feet and thought &#8220;Gee, this is silly.&#8221;  I simply had to let something go.  So, bye bye full-time job!  I&#8217;m now only working part-time (more on that later) to help pay the bills, and spending most of my time writing and editing my books.  And honestly, as much as I liked my old job and my co-workers there, I finally feel like Twist and I are really getting somewhere!  Expect great things&#8230;</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 2!</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/157210707/stained-kinetic-nautilus-gear-pendant?ref=shop_home_active_3" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="http://img1.etsystatic.com/024/0/7231497/il_570xN.481517455_3trs.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="192" /></a>I got a part-time job with <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/SteamyTech" target="_blank">SteamyTech</a>!  You know them, right?  Every good steampunk knows them.  They&#8217;re the people who make the wooden geared things that actually work.  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/SteamyTech" target="_blank">Go check out their Esty</a>.  SteamyTech is expanding and trying to get their lovely little toys and wooden bow-ties farther out into the world.  And that means that they need to cut loads of wooden bits on their fancy laser cutter&#8230;  That&#8217;s right, I now get to play with lasers.  I win!</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 3!</h4>
<p><a href="http://steampunkchronicle.com/SPCAwards/Voting/tabid/513/Default.aspx" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://steampunkchronicle.com/portals/4/SPCArticles/2014/Bestof/SPC_RCA_logo_2014_400.png" alt="" width="184" height="161" /></a>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, Clockwork Twist: Waking has been nominated for Best Fiction by the <a href="http://steampunkchronicle.com/" target="_blank">Steampunk Chronicle</a>!  I can hardly believe it, and I&#8217;m so honored.  Go check out what else has been <a href="http://steampunkchronicle.com/SPCAwards/Voting/tabid/513/Default.aspx" target="_blank">nominated for the best of steampunk</a>!  &#8230;and maybe, you know, scroll down to the literature section and &#8230; you know&#8230; (coy smile)  *Whispers* &#8220;It&#8217;s the &#8216;best fiction&#8217; one.  Clockwork Twist&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>My mother, the awesome poet<a href="http://janice-t.weebly.com" target="_blank"> JaniceT</a> has also been nominated for her book, Echoes: Neo-Victorian Poetry.  I&#8217;m ever so proud.  Voting will close on the 12th.  Just, you know, in case you wanted to know that&#8230; *wink, wink*</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 4!</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.inkshares.com/projects/clockwork-twist-dreamer" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="http://www.inkshares.com/assets/icons/inkshares_logo3_transparent-c6edf8081c45b265511a6baa98da1a8f.png" alt="" width="126" height="126" /></a>There&#8217;s still time to support Clockwork Twist and get sneak previews (and a free copy) of the 3rd book, Clockwork Twist: Dreamer, which will be out later this year!   Inkshares is a new crowdfunded publishing house, that is very excited to help propel the Clockwork Twist series into the world on a much wider distribution than it&#8217;s ever had before!<br />
Get in while it&#8217;s still new and trendy!  <a href="https://www.inkshares.com/projects/clockwork-twist-dreamer" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the Twist posting.</p>
<p>Wow!  That was a lot that my stupid blog didn&#8217;t post about.  Well, now you should be all caught up.  And if I missed anything, I&#8217;ll let you know about it all as soon as I remember!  I&#8217;m sorry about for the technical issues.  I hope you&#8217;ve all had a lovely few weeks as well!</p>
