<p>Apparently, I&#8217;m one of a scant few who sees more than just time in the face of a clock.  Let me ask you one little question, to see if you&#8217;re also an eurodite chronophile.</p>
<p>On a roman-numeral numbered clock face, how SHOULD the number &#8216;4&#8217; be written?</p>
<p>If you know your timepiece lore, this question would be either easy or controversial.  If you know your roman-numerals but not your clocks, you just answered wrong.  If you know neither, then sit back and learn, you lovely, young and innocent thing, you!</p>
<p><span id="more-511"></span>Now, as we know, roman-numerals run in a systematic sequence.</p>
<p>I = 1, II = 2, III = 3, IV = 4, V =5, VI = 6, and so forth, continuing on into constructions like XLII for 42 and the utterly ridiculous  MDCCCLXXVIII for 1878.</p>
<p>Knowing this, one would reason that the &#8220;4&#8221; on a clock should be &#8220;IV&#8221; as it would be for anything else.  However, humanity is far too goofy for that.  I&#8217;ve seen both &#8220;IV&#8221; and &#8220;IIII&#8221; on clocks from all different eras.  When I started to build the cover and promotional images for Twist, I realized that I had to find a rule to follow.</p>
<p>There are actually many, many stories and supposed reasons for why the &#8216;4&#8217;s would be written differently.  One story says that Louis XIV (14th, in case you have a headache) insisted it should be written &#8216;IIII&#8217; and, being the king, was not to be corrected.  Which is ironic, given the way we write his name.  I&#8217;ve also read that some clock makers simply like the look, one way or another, for reasons of symmetry.  Yet another theory says that it&#8217;s just plain easier to make simple iron bars than &#8220;V&#8221;s for the faces of large tower clocks.</p>
<p>By far my favorite theory hankers back to the very dawn of time keeping.  It seems that the Romans were the first to write out &#8220;IIII&#8221; on sundials.  Maybe it was because &#8220;IV&#8221; was Jupiter&#8217;s nickname.  Maybe it was because they liked the symmetry too.  Maybe they just couldn&#8217;t be bothered to be consistent.  Either way, once people started to make clocks instead of sundials, they left a little homage to those first great chronologists. on purpose.</p>
<p>And so, I decided to join the ranks of the &#8220;IIII&#8221;ers.  But is it really right or wrong to use either one?  It certainly isn&#8217;t a mistake, either way.  It&#8217;s just one more reason to gaze pensively into the beautiful faces of old clocks and pocket watches whenever you get the chance&#8230;</p>
