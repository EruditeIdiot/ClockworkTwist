<p>There will be two categories: Fan Art, and Cake Photo.</p>
<h4>Option 1, Fan Art Category:</h4>
<p>Any form of fan art is acceptable, be it drawing, photo-collage, sculpture, or even *ahem* fan-fiction&#8230; (glances to the side innocently like she&#8217;s never heard of slash fiction)  Since this is for Twist&#8217;s birthday, anything party themed would be great, but it&#8217;s really all up to you.  Use your imagination!  Note: if you happen to be a baker, and want to submit a photo of an original piece of pastry, be sure to mention that it&#8217;s not just a found photo in your post.</p>
<h4>Prize:</h4>
<p><strong>A signed paperback copy of the band new <a href="/book-three-dreamer/">Book Three: Dreamer</a>!  </strong>I&#8217;ll contact the winner later for mailing info.  All submissions and their artists, winning or otherwise, will also be featured on this site and all of Twist social media!</p>
<h4>Option 2, Cake Photo Category:</h4>
<p>Send me photos of steampunk birthday cakes!  This one is super easy.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be your own cake or photo, so please do reference the original artist/photographer/baker/source in your post just to be polite.  Simply find any photos of steampunk cakes, cupcakes, cakes shaped like pocket watches or top hats, or anything at all that reminds you of our dear Twist.  And, if possible, try to find an image that no one else has already submitted.  Also, feel free to submit as many times as you like!</p>
<h4>Prize:</h4>
<p><strong>A free eBook copy (in the format or your choice) of <a href="/book-three-dreamer/">Book Three: Dreamer</a>!</strong></p>
<h4>To Enter for either Fan Art or Cake Photo:</h4>
<p>Submit your work/photo using <strong>#HappyBirthdayTwist</strong> on either <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, from now until the 17th of November.  I&#8217;ll re-tweet, share, and re-blog everything as I find them, as well.  I will search and collect all submissions on the 18th, and the winner will be announced on the following Sunday, the 23rd.  Be sure to use the hashtag, so I can find your substitutions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that easy!   No fuss, no muss.  I&#8217;ll choose the winners in each category based strictly on feels, so anyone can win.  If you have any questions about the contest, feel free to ask in a comment on this post, but as I said above, please only submit your entries on social media, using <strong>#HappyBirthdayTwist</strong></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t WAIT to see what you all come up with!</p>
