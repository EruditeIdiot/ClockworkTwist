										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2685" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tumblr_ng6k25aZ6M1ttuh9eo1_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tumblr_ng6k25aZ6M1ttuh9eo1_500.jpg 500w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tumblr_ng6k25aZ6M1ttuh9eo1_500-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />Hello lovely.  I haven&#8217;t got any cute images or videos or other cheats today, and I&#8217;ve just had a load of announcements, so I thought I&#8217;d actually write a regular, rambling, blog post for once.  Fancy that?  A word of comment, first.  I started writing a post about what it&#8217;s like to write a series instead of a one-shot, about an hour ago and suddenly realized that it&#8217;s way too long.  Which will become hilarious in a minute.  So, this is part 1.  I&#8217;ll post part 2 later on.</p>
<p>Before I can really talk about my experience of writing a series, I feel I should give a bit more background about my writing history.  The first book I ever wrote was a sci-fi world-jumping novel, and it took me about a year to get the first draft on paper.  I started it in 1997 and I think I finished it in 1998, when I was a wee little 15 year-old.  Naturally, it was over 100,000 words and horrendous.  #noobwriter  But I re-wrote it about 14 times over the next 8 years (yes, I said 8), until it improved into a solidly mediocre and derivative piece.  Feeling pleased with my moderate success, I moved on to writing the sequel to this first book and was already thinking about it as a trilogy.  As of today, no one outside of my family and mentors have ever seen any of it, and now that I know what I&#8217;m doing no one ever will until it gets a massive overhaul.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s just re-count what my very first writing experience actually was.  I didn&#8217;t start with a short-story.  I didn&#8217;t even start with fan-fiction.  I started with a beef-stake sci-fi novel that turned into part 1 of a trilogy before I finished the first draft.  More than that, I was re-working the same story and the same basic plot for years, without really taking a break.  Sure, I was in school and had lots of things going on, but I was working seriously on that book/trilogy for about 8 years solid, and was trying to get it published, right up until I got another idea.</p>
<p>The second book I finished was inspired by my visits to Tokyo.  I went there a few times for vacation with a friend, then studied abroad in Tokyo a few years after that.  The book I wrote about Japan wasn&#8217;t sci-fi or fantasy at all, but was just general fiction, about riding the trains in Tokyo.  This time, I had a pretty good idea of how to put a book together before I started it, and I got it into a decent shape and polished enough to start shopping it around to my publishing contacts in less than two years, by 2007.  But since that was so much easier than stumbling about with my first trilogy, I immediately thought I might make the Japan book into a series, and also use it as an excuse to travel.  I could write the same kind of story in any city with trains, after all.  How about Paris, or New York, or Hong Kong?  Splendid!</p>
<p>Then, life hit me square in the nose.  For the first time in 10 years, I stopped writing because I just didn&#8217;t have the time.  I still tried from time to time to work up something fun or go back and add more to my old series, just for fun, but I had not series.  Things eventually calmed down in my life and I finally managed to write an actual short story in 2010.  It was about a man who was a projectionist at an old movie theater, and was obsessed with old movies from the 30s and 40s, rejecting modern life for the silver elegance of the past.  I still think it&#8217;s pretty good.  And I can&#8217;t tell you how thrilling it was to be writing again!  As soon as I finished the story, however, and saw that it came to a neat and elegant end, I felt an enormous sense of loss.  The story was over.  What a horrible thought.  I instantly rejected the idea and tried to stretch it into a book at least, but it just wasn&#8217;t there.  I had to let it go.</p>
<p>Desperate now to get back under that cozy, heavy, warm duvet of writing a series after years out in the cold, I picked up Steampunk.  I&#8217;d recently realized that all my favorite books and movies fit until that genre title, and was enamored with the whole idea.  But I&#8217;d never tried to write in it.  So, after my recent success, I started with a short story.  Before I got ten pages in, it became a book.  But, since I wasn&#8217;t used to Steampunk, it wasn&#8217;t working as well as I&#8217;d liked.  I kept swinging wide over historical fiction, then coming back over pure fantasy, without ever getting the feel for it.  Plus, as much as I liked the characters, they weren&#8217;t as good as the projectionist and his friends.  Frustrated, I decided to start over with a new idea entirely, just as soon as I came up with something.</p>
<p>Then, after seeing a fantastic live play that was a Steampunk version of <em>Twelfth Night</em>, something finally clicked in my head and I got a grip on Steampunk.  I went home after the play and wrote the first chapter of Waking.  The moment I saw Twist, I knew something was different.  He was special.  And by the time I was 5 pages in, I knew he needed room to run.  I decided, right there on the 5th page, to go for the series.  In three months (my personal best at the time) the first book was done and I&#8217;d started on the second.  With re-writes and edits of previous Twist books to pad out my time, I wrote another two 80,000 page novels in the next year, and two more the year after that.  Last year I wrote three.</p>
<p>So, in the last 17 years I&#8217;ve spent 3 not working on a series of some kind.  The only time I ever stopped a story and didn&#8217;t just shelve it for later continuation, it was traumatic.  I still miss Steve the projectionist sometimes.  I can&#8217;t imagine what I&#8217;m going to do at the end of Twist 12.  And no, I won&#8217;t just keep going because I watched Lost and I&#8217;m not going to do that to you.  There will be an ending, because Twist needs one to be whole.  But over the years, I&#8217;ve begun to realize that series writing is very much a comfy mental duvet for me.  Stuck in an elevator?  It&#8217;s cool, I&#8217;ll just work on pruning my mythology for a minute.  Can&#8217;t sleep?  Well, how <em>am</em> I going to get Twist to do that thing he really doesn&#8217;t want to do in that next scene?  Red Light?  No problem, I&#8217;ve got delicate social interactions between deeply damaged people to sort out.  It&#8217;s always there, and it&#8217;s soft and comfortable, and as familiar as pumpkin spice.</p>
<p>So, besides some rather obvious emotional issues I might want to stop ignoring, what does all this mean?  Is it possible that some writers just can&#8217;t do short while others just can&#8217;t do long?  Is it really that different at all?  I don&#8217;t know, but I hope to find out.  I&#8217;ll continue this idea in a later post.  In the meantime, please share your thoughts on writing in a comment.  Whether you&#8217;re an accomplished author, or just dabble in writing, I&#8217;d love to hear what your experience has been like.  Or have you noticed anything like this in your reading habits?  Let me know.  And thanks for reading so far.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2617" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1-cake-01-300x275.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="275" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1-cake-01-300x275.jpg 300w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1-cake-01-618x567.jpg 618w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1-cake-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Thanks to everyone who has been waiting for this release and sending me such lovely messages of encouragement!  You guys are awesome.  The best part  of this experience for me has to be all of the wonderful, generous, and supportive people I&#8217;ve met along the way!  I thought I was just going to write some books.  I never imagined I&#8217;d make so many friends because of Twist.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that just deliciously ironic?  Twist just thought he was going to go repair a bit of clockwork when he first left London, after all.  Now I think I really know how he feels.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Happy Birthday Clockwork Twist!</h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s to another year of intrepid adventures, startling discoveries, and unexpected friends.</p>

<p>Not to worry, though.  If these continue to sell well, I&#8217;ll just have to keep making more.  I&#8217;m also happy to do any sort of custom orders as well.  At the moment, my metal supplies are only of the same brass color, but I hope to branch out and try out some other antiqued metal colors as well.  Let me know in a comment if you have any suggestions.</p>
<p>And, of course, my very next design will be a replica of Twist&#8217;s watch from the books&#8230;  Keep an eye on this blog and my new store to see it as soon as I get it all put together!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After long hours of fine tuning, slight adjustments and giving myself eye-strain, I&#8217;m proud to announce that the cover for Dreamer is finally finished!!  This is not only the brightest cover in the Clockwork Twist series so far, but it was also the damn fiddliest.  Still, in the end, I&#8217;m quite happy with it.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_2557" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2557" class="wp-image-2557" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-670x1024.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="383" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-670x1024.jpg 670w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-196x300.jpg 196w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2557" class="wp-caption-text">Click to enlarge</p></div>
<p>After long hours of fine tuning, slight adjustments and giving myself eye-strain, I&#8217;m proud to announce that the cover for <a title="Book Three: Dreamer" href="/book-three-dreamer/" target="_blank">Dreamer</a> is finally finished!!  This is not only the brightest cover in the Clockwork Twist series so far, but it was also the damn fiddliest.  Still, in the end, I&#8217;m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>This book is a much brighter book than <a title="Book two : Trick" href="/book-two-trick/" target="_blank">Trick</a> and many of the other books, for content as well.  I&#8217;m currently writing the 8th book, and re-touching all the others in between but whenever I think back to Dreamer, I always end up smiling.  While it has it&#8217;s surprises and dangers, there are so many funny moments, and such a great sense of comfort and wonder about it, that it still remains one of my all time favorite books in the whole series.  Book five is really fun too&#8230;  And four!  Oh, Twist, I&#8217;m so sorry for book four.  Then, there&#8217;s six and seven&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway! I decided to show that brightness in the cover of Dreamer as well.  There is also (not really spoilers, I swear) a Native-American village that floats on a cloud, and a brand new character who has other people&#8217;s dreams whenever he falls asleep.  Having two different tribes in my own family background, I grew up with a  Cherokee-style dream-catcher always near the bed.  Naturally, the elements of this story brought that image to mind.</p>
<div id="attachment_2558" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2558" class="wp-image-2558 size-full" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="640" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg 900w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01-300x213.jpg 300w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01-618x439.jpg 618w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2558" class="wp-caption-text">Full back, spine and front cover. Click to enlarge</p></div>
<p>Of course, there are many different styles and corresponding meanings (or lack of meaning) attributed to each part of a dream-catcher, depending on it&#8217;s origin and the myths attached to it in different cultures.  For this reason, I did my best not to be too true to any one style.  My book is fiction anyway, so I didn&#8217;t want to make anything that might offend someone.  I simply replicated the general symbol that I remembered from my childhood and added the necessary beads, open center point, and feathers, while also matching the clock design that is on the cover of all of my books.  Naturally, I had to add some gears as well.  This <em>is</em> a steampunk book, after all.</p>
<p>So, what do you think?  Let me know how you like my new cover, in a comment down below.  I&#8217;m always looking to good feedback.  And also, don&#8217;t forget to enter to win a free copy of Dreamer before Twist&#8217;s birthday on the 17th!  The details of the contest are <a title="!!Fan art and photo contest!!" href="/blog/2014/10/19/fan-art-and-photo-contest/" target="_blank">right here</a>.  For the next three weeks, I&#8217;ll be posting free preview chapters of Dreamer here on my blog, as well, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>There will be two categories: Fan Art, and Cake Photo.</p>
<h4>Option 1, Fan Art Category:</h4>
<p>Any form of fan art is acceptable, be it drawing, photo-collage, sculpture, or even *ahem* fan-fiction&#8230; (glances to the side innocently like she&#8217;s never heard of slash fiction)  Since this is for Twist&#8217;s birthday, anything party themed would be great, but it&#8217;s really all up to you.  Use your imagination!  Note: if you happen to be a baker, and want to submit a photo of an original piece of pastry, be sure to mention that it&#8217;s not just a found photo in your post.</p>
<h4>Prize:</h4>
<p><strong>A signed paperback copy of the band new <a href="/book-three-dreamer/">Book Three: Dreamer</a>!  </strong>I&#8217;ll contact the winner later for mailing info.  All submissions and their artists, winning or otherwise, will also be featured on this site and all of Twist social media!</p>
<h4>Option 2, Cake Photo Category:</h4>
<p>Send me photos of steampunk birthday cakes!  This one is super easy.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be your own cake or photo, so please do reference the original artist/photographer/baker/source in your post just to be polite.  Simply find any photos of steampunk cakes, cupcakes, cakes shaped like pocket watches or top hats, or anything at all that reminds you of our dear Twist.  And, if possible, try to find an image that no one else has already submitted.  Also, feel free to submit as many times as you like!</p>
<h4>Prize:</h4>
<p><strong>A free eBook copy (in the format or your choice) of <a href="/book-three-dreamer/">Book Three: Dreamer</a>!</strong></p>
<h4>To Enter for either Fan Art or Cake Photo:</h4>
<p>Submit your work/photo using <strong>#HappyBirthdayTwist</strong> on either <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, from now until the 17th of November.  I&#8217;ll re-tweet, share, and re-blog everything as I find them, as well.  I will search and collect all submissions on the 18th, and the winner will be announced on the following Sunday, the 23rd.  Be sure to use the hashtag, so I can find your substitutions.</p>

<p>Hello lovelies, and hello October!  Let&#8217;s all go out and frolic in the leaves for the rest of the day.  What do you say?  No leaves where you are because California is being hot and crappy, or you&#8217;re in the southern hemisphere?  No matter.  There&#8217;s always pumpkin spice lattes and gifs.</p>
<p>But autumn doesn&#8217;t just mean it&#8217;s time for cooler weather, gorgeous grey skies and drizzle, and finally getting your scarf collection out of hiding.  It also means that November is just around the corner and there&#8217;s loads of Twist goodies soon to come!  First and foremost,</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Clockwork Twist, Book Three: Dreamer<br />
will be released on Nov 17th!</h4>
<p>The book is going through final edits right now, the cover is &#8230; well, <em>mostly</em> done-ish, and the first preview chapters will be up on this site very soon!  There will also be 3 different giveaways, a free eBook day, and other lovely treats to come.  Here&#8217;s a brief schedule of what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oct 1st-31st: Goodread giveaway for a signed copy of Waking.</li>
<li>Nov 1st-30th: Goodread giveaway for a signed set of both Waking and Trick.</li>
<li>Nov 2nd: The first preview chapter of Dreamer will post here on this site.</li>
<li>Nov 9th: The second preview chapter of Dreamer will post.</li>
<li>Nov 16th: The third preview chapter of Dreamer will post.</li>
<li>Nov 17th: <strong>Dreamer release!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Waking and Trick eBooks will be free all day on Smashwords.com!</li>
<li>Twist&#8217;s birthday blog party!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dec 1st-31st: Goodread giveaway for a signed set of all three, Waking, Trick, and Dreamer!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be putting up cover art (when I finish it&#8230;) and a few other surprise treats as well.  I&#8217;m not sure just now when all the other things I have in store for you will appear, so you&#8217;ll just have to keep an eye on this blog, or my other social medias.  But, the first treat is up right now!</p>
