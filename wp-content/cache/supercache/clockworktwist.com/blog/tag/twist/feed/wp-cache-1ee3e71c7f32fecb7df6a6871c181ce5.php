<p>Hello lovelies, and hello October!  Let&#8217;s all go out and frolic in the leaves for the rest of the day.  What do you say?  No leaves where you are because California is being hot and crappy, or you&#8217;re in the southern hemisphere?  No matter.  There&#8217;s always pumpkin spice lattes and gifs.</p>
<p>But autumn doesn&#8217;t just mean it&#8217;s time for cooler weather, gorgeous grey skies and drizzle, and finally getting your scarf collection out of hiding.  It also means that November is just around the corner and there&#8217;s loads of Twist goodies soon to come!  First and foremost,</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Clockwork Twist, Book Three: Dreamer<br />
will be released on Nov 17th!</h4>
<p>The book is going through final edits right now, the cover is &#8230; well, <em>mostly</em> done-ish, and the first preview chapters will be up on this site very soon!  There will also be 3 different giveaways, a free eBook day, and other lovely treats to come.  Here&#8217;s a brief schedule of what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oct 1st-31st: Goodread giveaway for a signed copy of Waking.</li>
<li>Nov 1st-30th: Goodread giveaway for a signed set of both Waking and Trick.</li>
<li>Nov 2nd: The first preview chapter of Dreamer will post here on this site.</li>
<li>Nov 9th: The second preview chapter of Dreamer will post.</li>
<li>Nov 16th: The third preview chapter of Dreamer will post.</li>
<li>Nov 17th: <strong>Dreamer release!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Waking and Trick eBooks will be free all day on Smashwords.com!</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Dec 1st-31st: Goodread giveaway for a signed set of all three, Waking, Trick, and Dreamer!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be putting up cover art (when I finish it&#8230;) and a few other surprise treats as well.  I&#8217;m not sure just now when all the other things I have in store for you will appear, so you&#8217;ll just have to keep an eye on this blog, or my other social medias.  But, the first treat is up right now!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello internet.  Usually on this blog, I share cool things that I find in the course of my steampunk existence or learn as a writer.  But since it&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day today, I thought I&#8217;d just tell you how Twist is doing.  I tend to call him &#8220;my baby&#8221; more often that he&#8217;d probably appreciate, and I love him so that I sometimes feel like a mother myself.  Don&#8217;t worry.  There&#8217;ll be more silly steamy things next week.</p>
<p>Since publishing <a title="Book one : Waking" href="/waking/" target="_blank">Waking</a> last year, and <a title="Book two : Trick" href="/book-two-trick/" target="_blank">Trick</a> last January, I&#8217;ve been working extra hard on finishing the first drafts of the rest of this 12 part series.  I&#8217;m getting ready to publish the 3rd book in the series later this year, and realizing that I&#8217;d like to be sure of exactly where the series is headed before I publish too much more.</p>
<p>Of course, I already know how I want the story to close at the end of the 12th novel, and I have copious notes on what will happen in the meantime, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;ve gotten there yet.  At the moment, while I write this post, I have completed writing (not editing) the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th books, along with 27 pages of the 7th.  So why, you ask, aren&#8217;t more of them out yet?  Because things in these books like to change over time.</p>
<p>As I write this series, I find that little details turn out to mean unexpected things as future events unfold on the page.  The events might occur just as I&#8217;d meant them to from the beginning, but sometimes the implications change.  And sometimes, I suddenly realize that I was completely wrong about a plot line and have to go in a totally different direction, while still following the same basic story line.  Some scenes that I mean to write turn out to be useless when I get to writing them, while other unexpected moments appear and surprise me by how perfectly they fit.  And sometimes (more often than I like to think) I realize that the book I just finished writing is actually a better fit for the fourth or fifth book in line, rather than the third, and I now have to write a whole other book or two between it and the last one.</p>
<p>With all of this flux, I hate to publish too close to where I&#8217;m writing.  When <a title="Book one : Waking" href="/waking/" target="_blank">Waking</a> first came out, I had already finished the 4th book and was half way through the 5th.  When <a title="Book two : Trick" href="/book-two-trick/" target="_blank">Trick</a> was published, I had added a different book in the 5th place, and then re-wrote the old 5th book to make it the 6th.  As long as I have about 4 books between where I&#8217;m writing and where I publish, I can feel confident that I won&#8217;t ever have to adjust anything in the published work to make the ending work.   It&#8217;s my goal, after all, is to share this story with you, in a smooth, complete, and solid form.</p>
<p>Are you writing a series as well?  Have you ever encountered these sorts of things?  Please leave me a comment down below if you have.  I&#8217;d love to know what you think about all of this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m working very hard to finish the series as quickly as possible, so that I can make sure it will be the best work it can be.  In the scene I just wrote a few days ago, Jonas casually mentioned that he, Twist, and Myra had already traveled to every continent on the globe, and ventured into orbit as well.  I so wish I could tell you all about what is happening right now in the 7th book, but I must hold my tongue!  But I can promise that there are wonderful things in store for you as you follow Twist into the future books.</p>
<p>I hope you have a lovely Mother&#8217;s Day, however you choose to spend it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though I know that Twist was born in 1852 in the world of the books, I happen to also know the exact night that I first began to write about my darling boy.  Twist has brought nothing but joy to my life since that fateful day.  Unfortunately, meeting me has brought him tremendous amounts of terror, pain, and sogginess.  His life was perfectly simple when he was alone with his clocks.  Still, considering all the good things he&#8217;s gotten by leaving home with Arabel, I think even Twist would agree that we have bettered each other over the years.</p>
<p>So, you ask, how do I manage to remember the first time I ever wrote of my darling Twist?  Well, let me tell you.  I had been trying to come up with a Steampunk story for a while, but I just didn&#8217;t have a strong enough idea of what I wanted to write.  Meanwhile, I heard that a local university was putting on a production of Twelfth Night, done fully in a Steampunk style.  Naturally, had to go.  I saw the play on Nov 17th, 2010, and I was blown away.  It was an amazing rendition of the old classic, and it was Steampunk to the core, complete with goggles, pirates,  transvestism, clockwork, and an Abney Park soundtrack.  Honestly, one of the best plays I&#8217;ve seen, and I&#8217;ve been to a fair few.</p>
<p>Inspired, my head still buzzing from the amazing play, I went home and wrote the first two chapters of Waking, and met Twist for the very first time.  I remember looking at those first few pages (which have never really changed from that first version) and realizing that I was looking at something that would change my life.  I could tell, right there in his quiet little attic, that Twist was going to take me on an adventure that would be leaps and bounds beyond everything I&#8217;d ever written before.  I&#8217;ve been writing for over 16 years now, but never anything as good as Twist.  And so far, he&#8217;s lived up to all of his heady and exciting promises.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-465 alignleft" alt="twist is 2" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/twist-is-2.jpg" width="302" height="403" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/twist-is-2.jpg 720w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/twist-is-2-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" />Since I kept my ticket stub for the play, I&#8217;ll always remember my darling&#8217;s birthday.  I usually celebrate it by my self, with a piece of cake and a copy of those first few pages.  But I would love nothing more than if others would celebrate with me!  This year I plan to release a special edition of Waking on Twist&#8217;s birthday, hopefully for free.  And if you&#8217;ve bought an eBook copy from any store, you&#8217;ll be able to download the new version for free as well on the same day.  Fingers crossed I can get that together by November.</p>
<p>So, mark the date!  Even if you just take your copy of Waking out to cake or ice cream, or if you&#8217;re artsy enough to do a bit a of fan art or something, take a photo and send it to me!!  Let&#8217;s make the day special for our introverted little hero.</p>

<p>This Simy is eerily close to the face that I originally imagined for Twist.  Only, there aren&#8217;t any good period costumes in my version of the game, and I imagined him with curlier hair.  Is this Simy anything like the man you see when you read CWTwist?  Leave a comment and let me know.  I&#8217;d love to find out what you envision!</p>
