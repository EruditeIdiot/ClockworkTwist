<p>I&#8217;m lazy.  I&#8217;m much rather spend time writing, reading, watching Supernatural all over again on Netflix, or assassinating people in Renaissance Italy (hello, PS3 game reference!) than do anything that feels like work.  And unless I need Tumblr therapy after a particularly heart-wrenching season finally, or I&#8217;m glued to Twitter praying in vain for a YES vote for Scotland&#8217;s indyref debate, social media always feel like work to me.  I know that many people count Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and all the others as fun-time, I just don&#8217;t.  I use them too, but I get board really easy.  However, as an indie author, it&#8217;s professional suicide to not build a following everywhere I can to help promote my books.</p>
<p>So, whether you&#8217;re like me and can&#8217;t be bothered to spend hours trying to gain followers on 10 different sites, or you just don&#8217;t have the time or know-how required, here are two tricks that I&#8217;ve used to save my sanity.</p>
<h4>First, the power of the Tumblr Queue:  <a href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://www.shannonassociates.com/home_boxes/tumblr-logo-vector_11212_1110912.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="90" /></a></h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re over 25, there&#8217;s only a slight chance that you have a Tumblr account or use it often.  But let me tell you, the fan-girls/boys of Tumblr are a mighty force.  More than that, Tumblr can be bent to the will of the time-challenges with just a few easy steps.  First of all, when you create a new post or re-blog, there are always 5 option to chose from, under the little arrow on the right of he blue button: 1 Post Now, 2 Add to queue, 3 Schedule, 4 Save as draft, and 5 Post privately.  Using the 1st option, your post will appear immediately.  But the true power of Tumblr comes from the 2nd and 3rd options.</p>
<p>If you decide to Queue your post, it will sit in a holding area, waiting to be automatically posted.  Once you queue something, you can then click on &#8220;Queue&#8221; on the right side of your Tumblr dashboard, and find setting on how often your account will auto-post your queued posts.  You can choose a range of time each day, and how many posts will appear each day.  Then, they will appear on their own, without you having to do another living thing.  The only thing to watch out for is the hashtags, which annoying re-set when you re-blog.  Just be sure to add them back in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that by spending 1 hard-core searching and re-blogging session, I amassed over 100 posts in my queue.  Now, I could have immediately re-blogged everything, but then my Tumblr feed would have been a huge spam-fest, and then silent.  Instead, the topical posts I found will appear in reasonable fashion, making it look as if my feed might be nice to follow&#8230;</p>
<h4>Second, the might and magic of IFTTT: <a href="http://ifttt.com/"><img decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://phandroid.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ifttt-logo-large.png" alt="" width="232" height="86" /></a></h4>
<p>So ok, now your Tumblr is running like a top, and people are starting to follow you there.  But you haven&#8217;t touched your Twitter for months and your Facebook is boring as heck.  Never fear, IFTTT is here!  IFTTT = If This Then That.</p>
<p>This magical site is one of the most powerful tools I&#8217;ve ever seen on-line.  Using this tool, you can silently link all sorts of things that don&#8217;t normally go together.  Wish your phone would alert you when there&#8217;s a rain warning in your area?  Want to get a text message every time the ISS flies overhead?  Want to make it so that all of your blogs post the same thing simultaneously without you having to lift a finger?  IFTTT can do that!  Just get yourself a free account, hook up all your accounts, and presto!  You&#8217;re suddenly a social media ninja.</p>
<p>My favorite tools to use are A) 500px-to-Tumblr-Drafts, B) WeHeartIt-hearted-images-to-Tumblr-drafts, C) Tumblr-image-post-to-Twitter-native-image-post, and D) Tumblr-to-Facebook.  A auto searches the site 500px for images tagged with my terms, and then dump them into my Tumblr Drafts folder so that I can curate them and add the ones I like to mt queue.  B automatically adds every image I heart on WeHeartIt to my Tumblr Drafts folder too.  Using these two tools, my queue grew from 100 to 300 in a week.</p>
<p>C fixes that nasty annoying thing that Twitter does when you share an image from another site.  If I just clicked the share button from Tumblr, my Twitter would only post a link, and not a full image.  Since this is a problem, anyone who does post full pictures gets a lot more attention on Twitter, so it&#8217;s nice to have them show up.  With this tool, I don&#8217;t even have to click share.  Any image that is posted on my Tumblr feed is automatically posted as a full image on my Twitter.  Now, my Twitter looks awesome, and I still hardly actually go there to use it.  D does the same thing as C, but with Facebook, so that my Facebook page feed gets love too, even when I hardly go there either.</p>
<h4>The up-shot:</h4>
<p>And why, you might ask, would it be worth all this set up to just get some pretty pictures up on my sites all the time?  Because, my books are steampunk, and steampunk fans are visual people.  If I want their attention, I&#8217;d better have lots of shiny pocket watches, battling airships, and the like to offer.  If your fans are more literary, then re-blog quotes and articles.  If your fans are romance junkies, then there&#8217;s plenty of provocative imagery and info on other romance books to share.  The point is, that once your feeds have nice things, and people searching for related tags find you, and start sharing you, their friends will follow you too, and their friends, and your fan base will only get bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you rather have hundreds and thousands of people already paying attention to your Twitter, Facebook, and even your Tumblr when you have something important to announce about the project you&#8217;re selling?  Doing this is the easiest way I&#8217;ve ever found to do just that, without having to spend time doing it all by hand.  My followers has already grown by 30% in the last few weeks alone.  My Tumblr queue is sitting pretty at over 300 posts ready to post, 3 a day, across three sites, for over 3 months solid.  In the coming months, I expect my followers to only grow faster and faster.</p>
<p>So, if you think that this sort of trick would improve your internet life, then give it a shot!  Share this post to anyone else you know who is in need of a quick fan-base, or just wants to build on what they already have.  And if you try it, please let me know how it works for you!  All I know is how it works for me, which is simply splendid.</p>
<p>And of course, follow me on the social media site of your choice.  <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-facebook" title="Follow Twist on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/CWTwist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="facebook"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Follow Twist on Facebook" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/facebook.png" alt="facebook" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-twitter" title="Follow Twist on Twitter" href="http://twiter.com/CWTwist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="twitter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Follow Twist on Twitter" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/twitter.png" alt="twitter" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-rss" title="Subscribe to Twist's RSS Feed" href="http://clockworktwist.com/feed/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="rss"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Subscribe to Twist's RSS Feed" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/rss.png" alt="rss" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-tumblr" title="Follow Twist on Tumblr" href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="tumblr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Follow Twist on Tumblr" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/tumblr.png" alt="tumblr" width="24" height="24" /></a></p>
