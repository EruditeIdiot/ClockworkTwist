										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1360558179l/17347983.jpg" width="189" height="285" /></p>
<p>Jennifer Thomson was having a fairly normal day until the bomb went off.  She survived the terrorist attack by the skin of her teeth, but a photo of her being rescued from the rubble became the single most iconic image of the event.  And that was when the trouble really started.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sean Kincade, a former covert operative, watched the whole attack and Jennifer&#8217;s rescue on TV.  Sick to death of his unwanted retirement in suburbia anyway, he decided to take matters into his own, highly skilled hands.</p>
<p>While I usually only mention steempunky things on this blog, I&#8217;m making an exception for this fantastic Author.  Sure, there&#8217;s no airships or goggles, but the story is tight, sophisticated, and riveting.  The story follows the protagonists in two separate timelines, much like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boneshaker-Sci-Fi-Essential-Books/dp/0765318415" target="_blank">Boneshaker</a> by Cherie Priest (See!  Steampunk reference!), which only makes the two feel all the more closely connected throughout the book.</p>
<p>Kelly Cozy is not the type to pull punches.  Reading this book is like watching 24: you&#8217;ll need a pillow to hide behind, but you won&#8217;t take your eyes off the screen for an instant.  And if you&#8217;re anything like me, you&#8217;ll be hooked by the first bomb blast.  Even if this type of book isn&#8217;t your normal fare, I highly recommend it as a thrilling, thought-provoking, and deeply emotional page-turner.</p>
