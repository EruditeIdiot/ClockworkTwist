<p>Want more than that?  Well, the first 3 chapters will appear right here on clockworktwist.com, starting on the 12th.</p>
<p>You STILL want more??  Greedy&#8230;  I guess there&#8217;s nothing for it.  You&#8217;re simply going to have to go reserve your eBook pre-order, right now.</p>

<p>Mind you, only the eBooks are pre-order-able at the moment, but the paperback is in final review and will also be coming soon.  If the stars align, it will be available on the 17th, just in time for Twist&#8217;s birthday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_2557" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2557" class="wp-image-2557" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-670x1024.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="383" srcset="https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-196x300.jpg 196w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2557" class="wp-caption-text">Click to enlarge</p></div>
<p>After long hours of fine tuning, slight adjustments and giving myself eye-strain, I&#8217;m proud to announce that the cover for <a title="Book Three: Dreamer" href="/book-three-dreamer/" target="_blank">Dreamer</a> is finally finished!!  This is not only the brightest cover in the Clockwork Twist series so far, but it was also the damn fiddliest.  Still, in the end, I&#8217;m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>This book is a much brighter book than <a title="Book two : Trick" href="/book-two-trick/" target="_blank">Trick</a> and many of the other books, for content as well.  I&#8217;m currently writing the 8th book, and re-touching all the others in between but whenever I think back to Dreamer, I always end up smiling.  While it has it&#8217;s surprises and dangers, there are so many funny moments, and such a great sense of comfort and wonder about it, that it still remains one of my all time favorite books in the whole series.  Book five is really fun too&#8230;  And four!  Oh, Twist, I&#8217;m so sorry for book four.  Then, there&#8217;s six and seven&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway! I decided to show that brightness in the cover of Dreamer as well.  There is also (not really spoilers, I swear) a Native-American village that floats on a cloud, and a brand new character who has other people&#8217;s dreams whenever he falls asleep.  Having two different tribes in my own family background, I grew up with a  Cherokee-style dream-catcher always near the bed.  Naturally, the elements of this story brought that image to mind.</p>
<div id="attachment_2558" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2558" class="wp-image-2558 size-full" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="640" srcset="https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg 900w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01-300x213.jpg 300w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01-618x439.jpg 618w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2558" class="wp-caption-text">Full back, spine and front cover. Click to enlarge</p></div>
<p>Of course, there are many different styles and corresponding meanings (or lack of meaning) attributed to each part of a dream-catcher, depending on it&#8217;s origin and the myths attached to it in different cultures.  For this reason, I did my best not to be too true to any one style.  My book is fiction anyway, so I didn&#8217;t want to make anything that might offend someone.  I simply replicated the general symbol that I remembered from my childhood and added the necessary beads, open center point, and feathers, while also matching the clock design that is on the cover of all of my books.  Naturally, I had to add some gears as well.  This <em>is</em> a steampunk book, after all.</p>
<p>So, what do you think?  Let me know how you like my new cover, in a comment down below.  I&#8217;m always looking to good feedback.  And also, don&#8217;t forget to enter to win a free copy of Dreamer before Twist&#8217;s birthday on the 17th!  The details of the contest are <a title="!!Fan art and photo contest!!" href="/blog/2014/10/19/fan-art-and-photo-contest/" target="_blank">right here</a>.  For the next three weeks, I&#8217;ll be posting free preview chapters of Dreamer here on my blog, as well, so stay tuned!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re thinking to self-publish your own delightful novel, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be spending weeks on end fine-tuning all of the myriad details, characters, plot twists, and themes of the writing.  However, have you thought of  what you&#8217;re going to put on the cover?  For many authors, this seems like an after thought.  But I can assure you that most people really do judge books by their covers, and having a strong design can have a huge impact on your sales performance.</p>
<p>Heavens above, did I just say &#8220;sales performance&#8221;??  Not sure I like being a business woman&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/full-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-554 alignleft" style="margin-top:20px;" title="click for full view" alt="" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/full-1.jpg?w=150" width="150" height="109" srcset="https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/full-1.jpg 1712w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/full-1-300x218.jpg 300w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/full-1-1024x746.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Anyway, I spent over 30 hours in Photoshop, working on the cover of <a title="Book one : Waking" href="http://clockworktwist.com/waking/" target="_blank">Waking</a>.  I wanted it be sure that I gave Twist my very best.  At Clockwork Alchemy I watched a lot of people glance over the books on the tables as they walked by, see Waking, stop, and then come back and pick it up.  Based on that alone, I feel it&#8217;s a strong design.  I don&#8217;t know what effect it&#8217;s having on-line, but my sales aren&#8217;t bad.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve been working recently on the cover for Trick, the next book in the <a title="Future Books" href="http://clockworktwist.com/future/" target="_blank">Clockwork Twist series</a>, I thought I&#8217;d take a second here to write a bit about what I&#8217;ve learned on the subject of book covers.</p>
<p><span id="more-549"></span></p>
<p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be an artist like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/srtsart" target="_blank">my Dad</a>.  I was an animation major for a while, and took just about every art class I could, simply for the fun of it.  But over time my creative skills started to shift away from visual art into writing.  Now, I count art as my hobby and spend most of my time writing.  So, when I realized that Twist needed a cover, I knew I had some skill already and so decided to give it a go of doing it myself.  I&#8217;m also a perfectionist and a control freak, and had the audacity to think that no one else could render my vision correctly.  So, while I&#8217;ve found success with my own design, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend that everyone does their own cover.  There are plenty of professionals to hire.</p>
<p>If you think you might want to give it a try, here&#8217;s some of the best tips and advice I&#8217;ve gotten.  First of all, subscribe to <a href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/" target="_blank">The Book Designer</a> and read everything you can.  This site, and it&#8217;s creator Joel Friedlander, has been an invaluable resource to me.  To summarize what I think are important points, here&#8217;s some quick advice bites.</p>
<p>1. No matter the colors, the images, or anything else on the cover, the title (and arguably the author name) has to be clear enough to read easily once you shrink the image down to thumbnail size.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-295 alignright" alt="CWT01 cover" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/try4.jpg?w=93" width="76" height="122" srcset="https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/try4.jpg 625w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/try4-187x300.jpg 187w" sizes="(max-width: 76px) 100vw, 76px" />I notice that a lot of indie authors who do their own designing seem to miss this idea.  And so, on Goodreads or Amazon it&#8217;s really hard to get any idea of what the book&#8217;s even about from the cover.  With my books, I decided that the most important thing is Twist&#8217;s name, and second is the volume title because I&#8217;m doing a series.  Since this is the first thing I&#8217;ve published, my name doesn&#8217;t meanmuch yet.  So, if you look at the Waking cover in a thumbnail, you can make out the words &#8220;Twist&#8221; and &#8220;Waking&#8221; even if you can&#8217;t read anything else.</p>
<p>2. Go to a bookstore.  Look at the books in the genre you&#8217;re writing in, take pictures of covers you like, and try to get an idea of what is normal for your kind of book.</p>
<p>You can also do this on Amazon, but I found that picking up real books and turning them in the light helped me a lot.  There is nothing even slightly wrong with taking elements from other designs.  In fact, it&#8217;s the best way to get a really strong image.  You don&#8217;t want to copy 100% of course, but you want your book to look like it belongs among these books.  Standing out with a really solid design can be great, but sticking out like a blond in Tokyo isn&#8217;t going to help.</p>
<p>3. Once you have a design fleshed out, print out a hard copy (like a 9&#215;5 photo) and take it to a bookstore.  Go to your genre section and put the image on the shelf next to other books and step back.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-560 alignleft" alt="bnn" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bnn.jpg?w=300" width="240" height="192" srcset="https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bnn.jpg 640w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bnn-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" />Looking at a computer for days, it&#8217;s easy to lose perspective.  If you take the image out into the world, you can get a better idea of how you&#8217;re actually doing.  Is it too light or dark against other covers that are like it?  Is it eye-catching from across the aisle?  Is the text as easy to read as the other books?  If you hadn&#8217;t put it there, what would you think it?</p>
<p>There is an endless supply of guides and advice on specific details of cover design online, but I found that following these few points really helped me to get a good image in the end.  And of course, there&#8217;s no shame in hiring a professional designer.  If you do decide to have someone else do your cover, though, I still suggest you do #3, and take the proof to a bookstore before you approve it.</p>
<p>I hope that helped!  If there are any specific questions that you have about cover design or anything related to self-publishing, please leave a comment below and I&#8217;ll I&#8217;d be happy to try to answer it.  Happy writing!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-513 alignright" alt="himitsu" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/himitsu.jpg" width="233" height="156" srcset="https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/himitsu.jpg 367w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/himitsu-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /></p>
<p>Apparently, I&#8217;m one of a scant few who sees more than just time in the face of a clock.  Let me ask you one little question, to see if you&#8217;re also an eurodite chronophile.</p>
<p>On a roman-numeral numbered clock face, how SHOULD the number &#8216;4&#8217; be written?</p>
<p>If you know your timepiece lore, this question would be either easy or controversial.  If you know your roman-numerals but not your clocks, you just answered wrong.  If you know neither, then sit back and learn, you lovely, young and innocent thing, you!</p>
<p><span id="more-511"></span>Now, as we know, roman-numerals run in a systematic sequence.</p>
<p>I = 1, II = 2, III = 3, IV = 4, V =5, VI = 6, and so forth, continuing on into constructions like XLII for 42 and the utterly ridiculous  MDCCCLXXVIII for 1878.</p>
<p>Knowing this, one would reason that the &#8220;4&#8221; on a clock should be &#8220;IV&#8221; as it would be for anything else.  However, humanity is far too goofy for that.  I&#8217;ve seen both &#8220;IV&#8221; and &#8220;IIII&#8221; on clocks from all different eras.  When I started to build the cover and promotional images for Twist, I realized that I had to find a rule to follow.</p>
<p>There are actually many, many stories and supposed reasons for why the &#8216;4&#8217;s would be written differently.  One story says that Louis XIV (14th, in case you have a headache) insisted it should be written &#8216;IIII&#8217; and, being the king, was not to be corrected.  Which is ironic, given the way we write his name.  I&#8217;ve also read that some clock makers simply like the look, one way or another, for reasons of symmetry.  Yet another theory says that it&#8217;s just plain easier to make simple iron bars than &#8220;V&#8221;s for the faces of large tower clocks.</p>
<p>By far my favorite theory hankers back to the very dawn of time keeping.  It seems that the Romans were the first to write out &#8220;IIII&#8221; on sundials.  Maybe it was because &#8220;IV&#8221; was Jupiter&#8217;s nickname.  Maybe it was because they liked the symmetry too.  Maybe they just couldn&#8217;t be bothered to be consistent.  Either way, once people started to make clocks instead of sundials, they left a little homage to those first great chronologists. on purpose.</p>
<p>And so, I decided to join the ranks of the &#8220;IIII&#8221;ers.  But is it really right or wrong to use either one?  It certainly isn&#8217;t a mistake, either way.  It&#8217;s just one more reason to gaze pensively into the beautiful faces of old clocks and pocket watches whenever you get the chance&#8230;</p>
