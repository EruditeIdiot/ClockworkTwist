										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After hosting my (first ever) panel at Clockwork Alchemy on the above topic, I was delighted to hear so many people tell me that the information I gave actually helped them out.  I really just repeated the advice and insights that I had taken from others, but apparently it was helpful enough for those who attended.  Who knew, right?</p>
<p>Then I suddenly realized, with great shock and dismay, that I had somehow stumbled onto that fabled thing I hear whispered about in shadows: &#8216;experience&#8217;.  I might not know much about the best way to go about publishing a novel, and I certainly don&#8217;t know very much at all about marketing, but I have done both now.  Perhaps my mistakes, stumbles, and occasional luck can manage to aid someone else in their own publishing adventure.  Perhaps not.  Maybe I&#8217;ve just had too much coffee today and I&#8217;m getting giddy.</p>
<p>Either way, I thought I&#8217;d post the hand-out from my little panel here in case anyone else might like to see it.  I&#8217;m also going to summarize what I talked about below.  Please enjoy, and I hope this can maybe help you too.  Also, whenever I think of anything else that might be useful for others hoping to publish, I&#8217;ll post it up here on my blog.  Of course, if anyone has a question, I&#8217;d be more than happy to try to answer it.</p>
<p><span id="more-454"></span></p>
<p>Okay!  First of all, a little about me and what I&#8217;ve done to get my darling Twist onto Amazon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing for about 16 years, and started working on Twist on November 17th, 2010.  Yes, I celebrate his birthday every year.  I started trying to get published about eight or nine years ago, with a totally different novel series, and ended up going to the <a href="http://www.sfwriters.org/" target="_blank">San Francisco Writers&#8217; Conference</a> in it&#8217;s 2nd year.  I then answered an add and began working for a literary agent as an office volunteer and learned just about everything in the world about querying agents by paying vary close attention to everything.  For the next five years I tried just about every angle I could to get anything into print.  I got two short stories out, won an award for a novel, made friends with loads of influential people, and received over 50 rejection letters for my various endeavors.  All in all, a respectable amount of success considering the average author path.  Life kept me from showing anything Twist-related to anyone but an old agent friend of mine, who gave me some good advice on revisions, but the typical lack of help on actually getting him into print.</p>
<p>Then, this year (2013) I went as usual to the <a href="http://www.sfwriters.org/" target="_blank">SFWC</a> in February.  By then I had written out four and half Twist novels (about 360,000 words in total) and gotten a decent amount of edits on the first book, <a title="Book one : Waking" href="http://clockworktwist.com/waking/" target="_blank">Waking</a>.  I&#8217;d also done some rough cover designing, and mapped out the plots of another 4 or 5 books in the series.  I brought the usual pitch package for <a title="Book one : Waking" href="http://clockworktwist.com/waking/" target="_blank">Waking</a> with me to the con, but I&#8217;d already began to wonder if self-publishing might not be a good idea after all.  Twist is niche-y, after all, being Steampunk.  I&#8217;ll sum-up now saying that in four days the fantastic and gratuitous people at the con had given me ALL of the information I needed to go from .doc to Amazon by self-publishing, a full crash course in marketing on-line and off, and the driving will to do it all.  One month and  four days later, I sold my very first copy (of anything I&#8217;d ever written).  As a cherry on top, that first copy sold in Taiwan of all places.</p>
<p>Ever since then, I&#8217;ve been stumbling about like a drunken camel through the literary internet to try to get my book into the public eye. As of today, I&#8217;ve sold something over 80 copies (I need to find a good way to keep count) and gotten a few very nice reviews.  Considering that I&#8217;ve done all the production and marketing myself, I consider this a success.  I&#8217;ve got 12 books in this series, so I&#8217;m not in a hurry.  I don&#8217;t see any need to be selling thousands of copies, just yet.</p>
<p>So, in my travels through the publishing landscape, I found that the old tried and true traditional route just wasn&#8217;t for me.  My book was always the wrong one at the wrong time.  Even if I knew that my book already had an audience, the big-wigs didn&#8217;t even know what the word &#8220;steampunk&#8221; meant.  I found that going rouge was the best possible choice for my unassuming little clock maker and his grand adventure.  Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean that the same path would be right of someone else.  We&#8217;ll see what happens in the end, but today I&#8217;m proud to be a rouge.</p>
<p>In my handout, you can find some bullet points of what to expect from both Traditional and Self-publishing, some quick notes on what worked for me, and a load of links to most of the sites, blogs, and people that got me this far.  I tried to make it speak for itself pretty well, be please feel free to leave a comment asking any questions you might have.  I hope it helps!</p>
