										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>See?  I told you it wasn&#8217;t all gonna be steampunk now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Maltese-Falcon-Dashiell-Hammett/dp/0679722645"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/MainTitle2MaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg" alt="Thanks, Wiki Commons!" width="455" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>I adore classic lit.  If they&#8217;ve made a massively iconic film of it in the 30s &#8211; 60s, if it appears on the &#8220;100 books to read before you die&#8221; lists, if I can find a battered old paperback of it that&#8217;s older than I am, I want to read it.  I think that tendency comes partly from the fact that I didn&#8217;t go to a typical high school.  As a kid, I was never forced to read anything, but my family and friend made the classics sound grand, beautiful, and mysterious.  Once I got a taste for them, I now always look to the past to find something great to read.</p>
<p>This month, I read The Maltese Falcon by Hammett.  I read The Thin Man earlier, and loved it, so why not try the big one?  Well, let me tell you, diving into Hammett&#8217;s world of noir isn&#8217;t like watching the movies.  Now, I love a Boggie movie any day, and William Powell is precisely what I look for in a man, so don&#8217;t get me wrong.  I love the movies that they&#8217;ve done with Hammett&#8217;s books, but the two versions are drastically different for many reasons.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/TypeHype1MaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="207" />First and foremost, Hammett&#8217;s writing style is singular.  I&#8217;ve read Chandler and others in the &#8220;hardball PI&#8221; genre, but I&#8217;ve never read anything like Hammett.  Reading this book, I was stunned by the fact that Sam Spades&#8217;s actions were never explained at all.  He often did things that confused me, or seemed unfeeling and cruel, and I was never given a single moment of explanation or excuse.  When Sherlock Holmes goes out in a hurry dressed at a vicar, and then comes home covered in blood at 3am, he always has a chance to explain what happened, and how it will help his case.  This is not the case with Sam Spade.  I was left with a vague uneasiness as I tried to guess his reasoning, and honestly, I find the man to be nearly as off-putting and frightening as Uriah Heep.</p>
<p>But even with this lack of explanation and emotional connection to the character, I couldn&#8217;t say that Sam didn&#8217;t feel completely real to me.  In fact, he felt more solid, whole, and real to me because he acted so independently, and because he was so damned unnerving.  Reading about him was like following a sociopath around all day.  When I re-watched the movie recently, I was stunned by how intrinsically likable and sympathetic the character became in Bogart&#8217;s hands.  The Sam of the movie and the Sam of the book are vastly different people, and I&#8217;m glad they are.  While I&#8217;m sitting here in awe of the response Hammett was able to get from me, I honestly don&#8217;t believe that the movie would have become such an icon if Boggie hadn&#8217;t played him the way he did.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/GutmanCairoMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg" alt="" width="319" height="239" />Other than Sam, there were a lot of differences between the movie that we all know, and the book that few have actually read.  One thing that surprised me was the clear evidence that Joel Cairo was meant to be gay.  However, nothing was said outright about it, and Joel wasn&#8217;t treated like any more of a caricature than the other characters.  He was simply more interested in the young gunman than he was in Bridget, which explained why she wasn&#8217;t able to seduce him the way she could with every other man she met.  Considering the times, I can easily understand why all of those tells were removed from the script.  It only makes the book that much more edgy for it&#8217;s time, which it was clearly meant to be.</p>
<p>Another thing that I found incredible about this book was the fact that no one in it ever said what they meant, and yet I was able to understand their true intentions easily.  Everyone, of course, but Sam who confused me consistently.  That kind of writing is risky because it&#8217;s easy for the reader to miss what&#8217;s really going on.  I really respect Hammett&#8217;s confidence to keep to this style, without a moment of hesitation.  Although most people in The Thin Man said exactly what they meant, in that book Hammett employed an equally brazen style that could have&#8211;but didn&#8217;t&#8211;go horribly wrong.  I get the feeling that each on of his books was an experiment in pushing the limits of writing.</p>
<p>In the end, I&#8217;m very happy I actually read this book, instead of just watching the movie.  I feel like I learned a lot about humanity, greed, desperation, and the high-art of writing a damn good book.  If you haven&#8217;t read this one, grab a copy and start reading it today.  Every second-hand bookshop in town is bound to have a few dog-eared copies on the shelf.</p>
