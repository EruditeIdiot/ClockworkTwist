										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2685" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tumblr_ng6k25aZ6M1ttuh9eo1_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" srcset="https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tumblr_ng6k25aZ6M1ttuh9eo1_500.jpg 500w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tumblr_ng6k25aZ6M1ttuh9eo1_500-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />Hello lovely.  I haven&#8217;t got any cute images or videos or other cheats today, and I&#8217;ve just had a load of announcements, so I thought I&#8217;d actually write a regular, rambling, blog post for once.  Fancy that?  A word of comment, first.  I started writing a post about what it&#8217;s like to write a series instead of a one-shot, about an hour ago and suddenly realized that it&#8217;s way too long.  Which will become hilarious in a minute.  So, this is part 1.  I&#8217;ll post part 2 later on.</p>
<p>Before I can really talk about my experience of writing a series, I feel I should give a bit more background about my writing history.  The first book I ever wrote was a sci-fi world-jumping novel, and it took me about a year to get the first draft on paper.  I started it in 1997 and I think I finished it in 1998, when I was a wee little 15 year-old.  Naturally, it was over 100,000 words and horrendous.  #noobwriter  But I re-wrote it about 14 times over the next 8 years (yes, I said 8), until it improved into a solidly mediocre and derivative piece.  Feeling pleased with my moderate success, I moved on to writing the sequel to this first book and was already thinking about it as a trilogy.  As of today, no one outside of my family and mentors have ever seen any of it, and now that I know what I&#8217;m doing no one ever will until it gets a massive overhaul.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s just re-count what my very first writing experience actually was.  I didn&#8217;t start with a short-story.  I didn&#8217;t even start with fan-fiction.  I started with a beef-stake sci-fi novel that turned into part 1 of a trilogy before I finished the first draft.  More than that, I was re-working the same story and the same basic plot for years, without really taking a break.  Sure, I was in school and had lots of things going on, but I was working seriously on that book/trilogy for about 8 years solid, and was trying to get it published, right up until I got another idea.</p>
<p>The second book I finished was inspired by my visits to Tokyo.  I went there a few times for vacation with a friend, then studied abroad in Tokyo a few years after that.  The book I wrote about Japan wasn&#8217;t sci-fi or fantasy at all, but was just general fiction, about riding the trains in Tokyo.  This time, I had a pretty good idea of how to put a book together before I started it, and I got it into a decent shape and polished enough to start shopping it around to my publishing contacts in less than two years, by 2007.  But since that was so much easier than stumbling about with my first trilogy, I immediately thought I might make the Japan book into a series, and also use it as an excuse to travel.  I could write the same kind of story in any city with trains, after all.  How about Paris, or New York, or Hong Kong?  Splendid!</p>
<p>Then, life hit me square in the nose.  For the first time in 10 years, I stopped writing because I just didn&#8217;t have the time.  I still tried from time to time to work up something fun or go back and add more to my old series, just for fun, but I had not series.  Things eventually calmed down in my life and I finally managed to write an actual short story in 2010.  It was about a man who was a projectionist at an old movie theater, and was obsessed with old movies from the 30s and 40s, rejecting modern life for the silver elegance of the past.  I still think it&#8217;s pretty good.  And I can&#8217;t tell you how thrilling it was to be writing again!  As soon as I finished the story, however, and saw that it came to a neat and elegant end, I felt an enormous sense of loss.  The story was over.  What a horrible thought.  I instantly rejected the idea and tried to stretch it into a book at least, but it just wasn&#8217;t there.  I had to let it go.</p>
<p>Desperate now to get back under that cozy, heavy, warm duvet of writing a series after years out in the cold, I picked up Steampunk.  I&#8217;d recently realized that all my favorite books and movies fit until that genre title, and was enamored with the whole idea.  But I&#8217;d never tried to write in it.  So, after my recent success, I started with a short story.  Before I got ten pages in, it became a book.  But, since I wasn&#8217;t used to Steampunk, it wasn&#8217;t working as well as I&#8217;d liked.  I kept swinging wide over historical fiction, then coming back over pure fantasy, without ever getting the feel for it.  Plus, as much as I liked the characters, they weren&#8217;t as good as the projectionist and his friends.  Frustrated, I decided to start over with a new idea entirely, just as soon as I came up with something.</p>
<p>Then, after seeing a fantastic live play that was a Steampunk version of <em>Twelfth Night</em>, something finally clicked in my head and I got a grip on Steampunk.  I went home after the play and wrote the first chapter of Waking.  The moment I saw Twist, I knew something was different.  He was special.  And by the time I was 5 pages in, I knew he needed room to run.  I decided, right there on the 5th page, to go for the series.  In three months (my personal best at the time) the first book was done and I&#8217;d started on the second.  With re-writes and edits of previous Twist books to pad out my time, I wrote another two 80,000 page novels in the next year, and two more the year after that.  Last year I wrote three.</p>
<p>So, in the last 17 years I&#8217;ve spent 3 not working on a series of some kind.  The only time I ever stopped a story and didn&#8217;t just shelve it for later continuation, it was traumatic.  I still miss Steve the projectionist sometimes.  I can&#8217;t imagine what I&#8217;m going to do at the end of Twist 12.  And no, I won&#8217;t just keep going because I watched Lost and I&#8217;m not going to do that to you.  There will be an ending, because Twist needs one to be whole.  But over the years, I&#8217;ve begun to realize that series writing is very much a comfy mental duvet for me.  Stuck in an elevator?  It&#8217;s cool, I&#8217;ll just work on pruning my mythology for a minute.  Can&#8217;t sleep?  Well, how <em>am</em> I going to get Twist to do that thing he really doesn&#8217;t want to do in that next scene?  Red Light?  No problem, I&#8217;ve got delicate social interactions between deeply damaged people to sort out.  It&#8217;s always there, and it&#8217;s soft and comfortable, and as familiar as pumpkin spice.</p>
<p>So, besides some rather obvious emotional issues I might want to stop ignoring, what does all this mean?  Is it possible that some writers just can&#8217;t do short while others just can&#8217;t do long?  Is it really that different at all?  I don&#8217;t know, but I hope to find out.  I&#8217;ll continue this idea in a later post.  In the meantime, please share your thoughts on writing in a comment.  Whether you&#8217;re an accomplished author, or just dabble in writing, I&#8217;d love to hear what your experience has been like.  Or have you noticed anything like this in your reading habits?  Let me know.  And thanks for reading so far.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2617" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1-cake-01-300x275.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="275" srcset="https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1-cake-01-300x275.jpg 300w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1-cake-01-618x567.jpg 618w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1-cake-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Thanks to everyone who has been waiting for this release and sending me such lovely messages of encouragement!  You guys are awesome.  The best part  of this experience for me has to be all of the wonderful, generous, and supportive people I&#8217;ve met along the way!  I thought I was just going to write some books.  I never imagined I&#8217;d make so many friends because of Twist.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that just deliciously ironic?  Twist just thought he was going to go repair a bit of clockwork when he first left London, after all.  Now I think I really know how he feels.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Happy Birthday Clockwork Twist!</h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s to another year of intrepid adventures, startling discoveries, and unexpected friends.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After long hours of fine tuning, slight adjustments and giving myself eye-strain, I&#8217;m proud to announce that the cover for Dreamer is finally finished!!  This is not only the brightest cover in the Clockwork Twist series so far, but it was also the damn fiddliest.  Still, in the end, I&#8217;m quite happy with it. This [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_2557" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2557" class="wp-image-2557" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-670x1024.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="383" srcset="https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-196x300.jpg 196w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2557" class="wp-caption-text">Click to enlarge</p></div>
<p>After long hours of fine tuning, slight adjustments and giving myself eye-strain, I&#8217;m proud to announce that the cover for <a title="Book Three: Dreamer" href="/book-three-dreamer/" target="_blank">Dreamer</a> is finally finished!!  This is not only the brightest cover in the Clockwork Twist series so far, but it was also the damn fiddliest.  Still, in the end, I&#8217;m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>This book is a much brighter book than <a title="Book two : Trick" href="/book-two-trick/" target="_blank">Trick</a> and many of the other books, for content as well.  I&#8217;m currently writing the 8th book, and re-touching all the others in between but whenever I think back to Dreamer, I always end up smiling.  While it has it&#8217;s surprises and dangers, there are so many funny moments, and such a great sense of comfort and wonder about it, that it still remains one of my all time favorite books in the whole series.  Book five is really fun too&#8230;  And four!  Oh, Twist, I&#8217;m so sorry for book four.  Then, there&#8217;s six and seven&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway! I decided to show that brightness in the cover of Dreamer as well.  There is also (not really spoilers, I swear) a Native-American village that floats on a cloud, and a brand new character who has other people&#8217;s dreams whenever he falls asleep.  Having two different tribes in my own family background, I grew up with a  Cherokee-style dream-catcher always near the bed.  Naturally, the elements of this story brought that image to mind.</p>
<div id="attachment_2558" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2558" class="wp-image-2558 size-full" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="640" srcset="https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg 900w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01-300x213.jpg 300w, https://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01-618x439.jpg 618w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2558" class="wp-caption-text">Full back, spine and front cover. Click to enlarge</p></div>
<p>Of course, there are many different styles and corresponding meanings (or lack of meaning) attributed to each part of a dream-catcher, depending on it&#8217;s origin and the myths attached to it in different cultures.  For this reason, I did my best not to be too true to any one style.  My book is fiction anyway, so I didn&#8217;t want to make anything that might offend someone.  I simply replicated the general symbol that I remembered from my childhood and added the necessary beads, open center point, and feathers, while also matching the clock design that is on the cover of all of my books.  Naturally, I had to add some gears as well.  This <em>is</em> a steampunk book, after all.</p>
<p>So, what do you think?  Let me know how you like my new cover, in a comment down below.  I&#8217;m always looking to good feedback.  And also, don&#8217;t forget to enter to win a free copy of Dreamer before Twist&#8217;s birthday on the 17th!  The details of the contest are <a title="!!Fan art and photo contest!!" href="/blog/2014/10/19/fan-art-and-photo-contest/" target="_blank">right here</a>.  For the next three weeks, I&#8217;ll be posting free preview chapters of Dreamer here on my blog, as well, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>Hello lovelies, and hello October!  Let&#8217;s all go out and frolic in the leaves for the rest of the day.  What do you say?  No leaves where you are because California is being hot and crappy, or you&#8217;re in the southern hemisphere?  No matter.  There&#8217;s always pumpkin spice lattes and gifs.</p>
<p>But autumn doesn&#8217;t just mean it&#8217;s time for cooler weather, gorgeous grey skies and drizzle, and finally getting your scarf collection out of hiding.  It also means that November is just around the corner and there&#8217;s loads of Twist goodies soon to come!  First and foremost,</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Clockwork Twist, Book Three: Dreamer<br />
will be released on Nov 17th!</h4>
<p>The book is going through final edits right now, the cover is &#8230; well, <em>mostly</em> done-ish, and the first preview chapters will be up on this site very soon!  There will also be 3 different giveaways, a free eBook day, and other lovely treats to come.  Here&#8217;s a brief schedule of what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oct 1st-31st: Goodread giveaway for a signed copy of Waking.</li>
<li>Nov 1st-30th: Goodread giveaway for a signed set of both Waking and Trick.</li>
<li>Nov 2nd: The first preview chapter of Dreamer will post here on this site.</li>
<li>Nov 9th: The second preview chapter of Dreamer will post.</li>
<li>Nov 16th: The third preview chapter of Dreamer will post.</li>
<li>Nov 17th: <strong>Dreamer release!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Waking and Trick eBooks will be free all day on Smashwords.com!</li>
<li>Twist&#8217;s birthday blog party!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dec 1st-31st: Goodread giveaway for a signed set of all three, Waking, Trick, and Dreamer!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be putting up cover art (when I finish it&#8230;) and a few other surprise treats as well.  I&#8217;m not sure just now when all the other things I have in store for you will appear, so you&#8217;ll just have to keep an eye on this blog, or my other social medias.  But, the first treat is up right now!</p>

<p>I found this wonderful set of positive writerly thoughts on Tumblr and thought I&#8217;d give them a share.  Click any of the images to visit the <a href="http://maxkirin.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">original blog</a>.  I found the combos thanks to <a href="http://bookworm-goddess.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">bookworm-goddess</a>, who also has a great Tumblr.  I highly recommend following them both.  Enjoy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/024350e2f7bccc3f920ee521be136160/tumblr_nc98uhTub01rpuw07o1_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="337" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image taken from thegoodvybe&#8217;s Tumblr feed</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m lazy.  I&#8217;m much rather spend time writing, reading, watching Supernatural all over again on Netflix, or assassinating people in Renaissance Italy (hello, PS3 game reference!) than do anything that feels like work.  And unless I need Tumblr therapy after a particularly heart-wrenching season finally, or I&#8217;m glued to Twitter praying in vain for a YES vote for Scotland&#8217;s indyref debate, social media always feel like work to me.  I know that many people count Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and all the others as fun-time, I just don&#8217;t.  I use them too, but I get board really easy.  However, as an indie author, it&#8217;s professional suicide to not build a following everywhere I can to help promote my books.</p>
<p>So, whether you&#8217;re like me and can&#8217;t be bothered to spend hours trying to gain followers on 10 different sites, or you just don&#8217;t have the time or know-how required, here are two tricks that I&#8217;ve used to save my sanity.</p>
<h4>First, the power of the Tumblr Queue:  <a href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://www.shannonassociates.com/home_boxes/tumblr-logo-vector_11212_1110912.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="90" /></a></h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re over 25, there&#8217;s only a slight chance that you have a Tumblr account or use it often.  But let me tell you, the fan-girls/boys of Tumblr are a mighty force.  More than that, Tumblr can be bent to the will of the time-challenges with just a few easy steps.  First of all, when you create a new post or re-blog, there are always 5 option to chose from, under the little arrow on the right of he blue button: 1 Post Now, 2 Add to queue, 3 Schedule, 4 Save as draft, and 5 Post privately.  Using the 1st option, your post will appear immediately.  But the true power of Tumblr comes from the 2nd and 3rd options.</p>
<p>If you decide to Queue your post, it will sit in a holding area, waiting to be automatically posted.  Once you queue something, you can then click on &#8220;Queue&#8221; on the right side of your Tumblr dashboard, and find setting on how often your account will auto-post your queued posts.  You can choose a range of time each day, and how many posts will appear each day.  Then, they will appear on their own, without you having to do another living thing.  The only thing to watch out for is the hashtags, which annoying re-set when you re-blog.  Just be sure to add them back in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that by spending 1 hard-core searching and re-blogging session, I amassed over 100 posts in my queue.  Now, I could have immediately re-blogged everything, but then my Tumblr feed would have been a huge spam-fest, and then silent.  Instead, the topical posts I found will appear in reasonable fashion, making it look as if my feed might be nice to follow&#8230;</p>
<h4>Second, the might and magic of IFTTT: <a href="http://ifttt.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://phandroid.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ifttt-logo-large.png" alt="" width="232" height="86" /></a></h4>
<p>So ok, now your Tumblr is running like a top, and people are starting to follow you there.  But you haven&#8217;t touched your Twitter for months and your Facebook is boring as heck.  Never fear, IFTTT is here!  IFTTT = If This Then That.</p>
<p>This magical site is one of the most powerful tools I&#8217;ve ever seen on-line.  Using this tool, you can silently link all sorts of things that don&#8217;t normally go together.  Wish your phone would alert you when there&#8217;s a rain warning in your area?  Want to get a text message every time the ISS flies overhead?  Want to make it so that all of your blogs post the same thing simultaneously without you having to lift a finger?  IFTTT can do that!  Just get yourself a free account, hook up all your accounts, and presto!  You&#8217;re suddenly a social media ninja.</p>
<p>My favorite tools to use are A) 500px-to-Tumblr-Drafts, B) WeHeartIt-hearted-images-to-Tumblr-drafts, C) Tumblr-image-post-to-Twitter-native-image-post, and D) Tumblr-to-Facebook.  A auto searches the site 500px for images tagged with my terms, and then dump them into my Tumblr Drafts folder so that I can curate them and add the ones I like to mt queue.  B automatically adds every image I heart on WeHeartIt to my Tumblr Drafts folder too.  Using these two tools, my queue grew from 100 to 300 in a week.</p>
<p>C fixes that nasty annoying thing that Twitter does when you share an image from another site.  If I just clicked the share button from Tumblr, my Twitter would only post a link, and not a full image.  Since this is a problem, anyone who does post full pictures gets a lot more attention on Twitter, so it&#8217;s nice to have them show up.  With this tool, I don&#8217;t even have to click share.  Any image that is posted on my Tumblr feed is automatically posted as a full image on my Twitter.  Now, my Twitter looks awesome, and I still hardly actually go there to use it.  D does the same thing as C, but with Facebook, so that my Facebook page feed gets love too, even when I hardly go there either.</p>
<h4>The up-shot:</h4>
<p>And why, you might ask, would it be worth all this set up to just get some pretty pictures up on my sites all the time?  Because, my books are steampunk, and steampunk fans are visual people.  If I want their attention, I&#8217;d better have lots of shiny pocket watches, battling airships, and the like to offer.  If your fans are more literary, then re-blog quotes and articles.  If your fans are romance junkies, then there&#8217;s plenty of provocative imagery and info on other romance books to share.  The point is, that once your feeds have nice things, and people searching for related tags find you, and start sharing you, their friends will follow you too, and their friends, and your fan base will only get bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you rather have hundreds and thousands of people already paying attention to your Twitter, Facebook, and even your Tumblr when you have something important to announce about the project you&#8217;re selling?  Doing this is the easiest way I&#8217;ve ever found to do just that, without having to spend time doing it all by hand.  My followers has already grown by 30% in the last few weeks alone.  My Tumblr queue is sitting pretty at over 300 posts ready to post, 3 a day, across three sites, for over 3 months solid.  In the coming months, I expect my followers to only grow faster and faster.</p>
<p>So, if you think that this sort of trick would improve your internet life, then give it a shot!  Share this post to anyone else you know who is in need of a quick fan-base, or just wants to build on what they already have.  And if you try it, please let me know how it works for you!  All I know is how it works for me, which is simply splendid.</p>
<p>And of course, follow me on the social media site of your choice.  <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-facebook" title="Follow Twist on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/CWTwist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="facebook"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Follow Twist on Facebook" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/facebook.png" alt="facebook" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-twitter" title="Follow Twist on Twitter" href="http://twiter.com/CWTwist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="twitter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Follow Twist on Twitter" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/twitter.png" alt="twitter" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-rss" title="Subscribe to Twist's RSS Feed" href="http://clockworktwist.com/feed/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="rss"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Subscribe to Twist's RSS Feed" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/rss.png" alt="rss" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-tumblr" title="Follow Twist on Tumblr" href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="tumblr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Follow Twist on Tumblr" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/tumblr.png" alt="tumblr" width="24" height="24" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wing-Dare-Flying-Horse-Books-ebook/dp/B00B3OF412/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1356997109l/14741800.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="362" /></a>I was lucky enough to meet Linda Ulleseit, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wing-Dare-Flying-Horse-Books-ebook/dp/B00B3OF412/" target="_blank">On a Wing and a Dare</a>, at a local author event last year.  Since then, she has been a gracious supporter of <a title="Book one : Waking" href="/waking/" target="_blank">my series</a>, while I&#8217;ve failed utterly to return the favor.  Now, I have FINALLY gotten a spare moment to give the first book in her <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/102454-flying-horse-books" target="_blank">Flying Horse Books</a> series a good read, and I&#8217;m so glad that I did!</p>
<p>The story takes place in a mythical and equine-centric version Whales (which is plenty of reason for me to like it right away, but more on that later) where the best job in the world is to be a flying-horse rider for one of the most prominent barns.  These daring riders compete in aerial games of skill on their beautiful winged steeds, to adoration and fame.  But, despite the fact that two of the most powerful barns have been grumbling through a feud for generations, the children of these two barns are the best of friends.  Poor Emma, the charming and precocious daughter of Hoel&#8217;s barn, has her heart set on her childhood friend, Even, the handsome eldest son of Morgan&#8217;s barn.  Meanwhile, Davyd, Even&#8217;s darling and clever younger brother, is also a close friend to Emma and has developed his own feeling for her, as well.  Amid this already complex social situation, the winged horses are suddenly falling ill from a mysterious sickness.  Will Hoel and Morgan put their differences aside for the sake of their horses?  Will Emma ever be free to marry the man she truly loves?  Will sweet little Davyd ever catch a break??  You&#8217;ll just have to read for yourself to find out!</p>
<p>First of all, I have to say that I was sucked into the world of this story right away.  This is partly because, like many silly Americans, I often internally glamorize my English, Scottish, and Welsh roots, and lament never having the chance to visit much of the homeland.  Just as I&#8217;d hoped when first hearing that Whales was the setting of the story, Linda&#8217;s writing is flush with atmospheric details of the lofty mountains, the rolling green hills, and the wild winds.  I was delighted by how easily I found myself transported into such a vivid world.  Linda also used Welsh language in the dialog, which added a lovely flavor without ever being excluding to someone (like me) who has no knowledge of the language.  Instead, the meaning of every phrase was easy to deduce, or swiftly explained, with expert ease.  The details of the environments were also not too numerous to feel forced, but came off as natural and earnest, which can sometimes be rather rare in modern writing.</p>
<p>Aside from the beautiful backdrop of the story, the characters were all very well defined and interesting.  I found myself enjoying poor tortured Davyd most of all, who is expected to be a great flying-horse rider like his brother and everyone else in his family, but is terrified of heights.  How can you not instantly feel for the boy?  As Davyd struggled with his shameful secret of not actually wanting to be a rider, while also trying to reconcile his brand new feeling for his oldest friend, and nearly singlehandedly administrate the arrangements for a massive event like the annual aerial games in the midst of a equine health crisis, I found myself only caring more and more for him.  But even with my preference, I must admit that each character had a surprising amount of depth, roundness, and charming understandably.  All but Tristain, who&#8217;s really just a jerk.  But then, the strength of my dislike for him is only a credit to the author.  Love and hate both require equal skill to produce in a reader.</p>
<p>So, if you can&#8217;t afford a vacation to Whales, or if you just want to read a well written, exciting, and truly charming book, then I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wing-Dare-Flying-Horse-Books-ebook/dp/B00B3OF412/" target="_blank">On a Wing and a Dare</a>.  I never thought I would so enjoy a YA book about flying horses, and I&#8217;m delighted to find that I was so wrong.  I can&#8217;t wait to read the rest of the series as well!  Even if this story isn&#8217;t your usual genre, trust me.  It&#8217;s worth giving it a try.</p>
<p>Get the eBook  on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wing-Dare-Flying-Horse-Books-ebook/dp/B00B3OF412/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, or on <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/282169" target="_blank">Smashwords</a>.  Only $2.99!  The paperback is also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wing-Dare-Flying-Horse-Books-ebook/dp/B00B3OF412/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the series on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/series/102454-flying-horse-books" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>.</p>

<p>Hello, lovelies!  Sorry about stepping out like that.  Right after I put this blog on pause, the chaos in my life intensified exponentially.  Typical, right?  Not to whine, and not to go into too much detail, I had a failed surgery, then a much better one that fixed the problem, lost two dear friends suddenly and in the space of a week, lost my job, got another job and then lost that very quickly.  When I paused the blog, I was only expecting the surgery part, not any of the rest.  Now that things have calmed down somewhat, I&#8217;m starting to get my feet back under me.  My family and I went to the circus just for the hell of it, went to see our favorite comedian preform, and I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy a few times too.  It&#8217;s funny how sometimes even the silliest and more trivial things can trigger true healing, isn&#8217;t it?  And so, here I am.  Still a bit dizzy, but back in the world!  lol</p>
<p>In the meantime, all things Twist have been progressing nicely.  Honestly, Twist was the only thing I wanted to work on through all of my troubles.  It was just a nice, cozy place to be.  Book 3 is in final edits as we speak, and I&#8217;m nearly finished with the cover design!  I&#8217;m so excited to show you all!  I&#8217;ll have a preview of the cover up soon, along with the first 3 chapters, as usual.  Stay tuned!</p>
<p><a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Jeffery</a> is also starting to get some attention as well, which pleases me greatly.  The 11th chapter of his little story will go live on Thursday, and <a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/journal-entries/" target="_blank">all the previous chapters</a> are still available to enjoy.  I&#8217;m going to leave that book on his blog indefinitely, as a forever freebie, just for you.  But I&#8217;ll also be releasing it as an eBook and paperback as well, at the lowest price The Great And Powerful Amazon will allow.</p>
<p>Other than all of that, I discovered something magical!  Have you ever used <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>?  It&#8217;s amazing.  I&#8217;m probably going to do a whole blog post about it soon, and how I&#8217;m using it&#8217;s awesome might to my own ends.  In the meantime, check out my <a href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/cwtwist" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/CWTwist" target="_blank">Facebook</a> for daily visual treats.  And that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll say for now&#8230;</p>
<p>Lastly, I&#8217;d like to mention that I&#8217;m going to be changing things up a little around here.  You might see less pure steampunk things in the future.  Following a single theme was very helpful for me as I learned the art of blogging and social mediaing, but now it&#8217;s becoming restrictive.  There&#8217;s plenty of beauty and great stories in the world, outside of one genre.  I&#8217;ll still be sharing lots of Victorian goodies and as many pretty pocket watches as I can find, but there were be less steamy items as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking around, while I dealt with my issues.  You guys are the best!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
