										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_2557" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2557" class="wp-image-2557" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-670x1024.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="383" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-670x1024.jpg 670w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover-196x300.jpg 196w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Front-Cover.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2557" class="wp-caption-text">Click to enlarge</p></div>
<p>After long hours of fine tuning, slight adjustments and giving myself eye-strain, I&#8217;m proud to announce that the cover for <a title="Book Three: Dreamer" href="/book-three-dreamer/" target="_blank">Dreamer</a> is finally finished!!  This is not only the brightest cover in the Clockwork Twist series so far, but it was also the damn fiddliest.  Still, in the end, I&#8217;m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>This book is a much brighter book than <a title="Book two : Trick" href="/book-two-trick/" target="_blank">Trick</a> and many of the other books, for content as well.  I&#8217;m currently writing the 8th book, and re-touching all the others in between but whenever I think back to Dreamer, I always end up smiling.  While it has it&#8217;s surprises and dangers, there are so many funny moments, and such a great sense of comfort and wonder about it, that it still remains one of my all time favorite books in the whole series.  Book five is really fun too&#8230;  And four!  Oh, Twist, I&#8217;m so sorry for book four.  Then, there&#8217;s six and seven&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway! I decided to show that brightness in the cover of Dreamer as well.  There is also (not really spoilers, I swear) a Native-American village that floats on a cloud, and a brand new character who has other people&#8217;s dreams whenever he falls asleep.  Having two different tribes in my own family background, I grew up with a  Cherokee-style dream-catcher always near the bed.  Naturally, the elements of this story brought that image to mind.</p>
<div id="attachment_2558" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2558" class="wp-image-2558 size-full" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="640" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01.jpg 900w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01-300x213.jpg 300w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Full-Cover-01-618x439.jpg 618w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2558" class="wp-caption-text">Full back, spine and front cover. Click to enlarge</p></div>
<p>Of course, there are many different styles and corresponding meanings (or lack of meaning) attributed to each part of a dream-catcher, depending on it&#8217;s origin and the myths attached to it in different cultures.  For this reason, I did my best not to be too true to any one style.  My book is fiction anyway, so I didn&#8217;t want to make anything that might offend someone.  I simply replicated the general symbol that I remembered from my childhood and added the necessary beads, open center point, and feathers, while also matching the clock design that is on the cover of all of my books.  Naturally, I had to add some gears as well.  This <em>is</em> a steampunk book, after all.</p>
<p>So, what do you think?  Let me know how you like my new cover, in a comment down below.  I&#8217;m always looking to good feedback.  And also, don&#8217;t forget to enter to win a free copy of Dreamer before Twist&#8217;s birthday on the 17th!  The details of the contest are <a title="!!Fan art and photo contest!!" href="/blog/2014/10/19/fan-art-and-photo-contest/" target="_blank">right here</a>.  For the next three weeks, I&#8217;ll be posting free preview chapters of Dreamer here on my blog, as well, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>Hello lovelies, and hello October!  Let&#8217;s all go out and frolic in the leaves for the rest of the day.  What do you say?  No leaves where you are because California is being hot and crappy, or you&#8217;re in the southern hemisphere?  No matter.  There&#8217;s always pumpkin spice lattes and gifs.</p>
<p>But autumn doesn&#8217;t just mean it&#8217;s time for cooler weather, gorgeous grey skies and drizzle, and finally getting your scarf collection out of hiding.  It also means that November is just around the corner and there&#8217;s loads of Twist goodies soon to come!  First and foremost,</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Clockwork Twist, Book Three: Dreamer<br />
will be released on Nov 17th!</h4>
<p>The book is going through final edits right now, the cover is &#8230; well, <em>mostly</em> done-ish, and the first preview chapters will be up on this site very soon!  There will also be 3 different giveaways, a free eBook day, and other lovely treats to come.  Here&#8217;s a brief schedule of what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oct 1st-31st: Goodread giveaway for a signed copy of Waking.</li>
<li>Nov 1st-30th: Goodread giveaway for a signed set of both Waking and Trick.</li>
<li>Nov 2nd: The first preview chapter of Dreamer will post here on this site.</li>
<li>Nov 9th: The second preview chapter of Dreamer will post.</li>
<li>Nov 16th: The third preview chapter of Dreamer will post.</li>
<li>Nov 17th: <strong>Dreamer release!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Waking and Trick eBooks will be free all day on Smashwords.com!</li>
<li>Twist&#8217;s birthday blog party!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dec 1st-31st: Goodread giveaway for a signed set of all three, Waking, Trick, and Dreamer!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be putting up cover art (when I finish it&#8230;) and a few other surprise treats as well.  I&#8217;m not sure just now when all the other things I have in store for you will appear, so you&#8217;ll just have to keep an eye on this blog, or my other social medias.  But, the first treat is up right now!</p>

<p>Hello, lovelies.  I can&#8217;t blame my blog on missing a post yesterday, or the lesser content that I&#8217;ve had to offer recently.  Like a sagging dirigible in a gale, I&#8217;m simply getting a bit swamped by my life and things are starting to slip through my rigging.</p>
<p>I want to write interesting, engaging posts, and share wonderful shiny things, and keep a real sense of delight in this blog.  At the moment, however, I find I simply don&#8217;t have the time and energy needed to keep this blog running at the level that I want.</p>
<p>So, for the time being, I&#8217;ve decided to take a short holiday from this blog so that I might recollect myself, get my ducks in a row, and all of that.  Don&#8217;t worry about the progress of the novels.  Writing is still my first priority.  The 3rd novel in the Clockwork Twist series is still set for release in November this year, I&#8217;ve just finished the first draft of the 7th book, and I&#8217;m beginning to work on the 8th now.<br />
<a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/journal-entries/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://jefferysimian.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/front-cover-test.jpg?w=196&amp;h=300" alt="" width="181" height="276" /></a><br />
To tide you over in the meantime, I encourage you to check out <a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">The Journals of Jeffery Simian</a> over on <a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/journal-entries/" target="_blank">Jeffery&#8217;s blog</a>.  The first serialized novelette is already running, with 5 whole chapters available for your reading pleasure right now, and new chapters each week!  It&#8217;s a fun little romp through the Clockwork Twist universe, from the perspective of our favorite gentlemanly baboon.  Travel to a circus made entirely of ice and battle winter faeries with Jeffery and Idris, his faithful djinn companion.  It&#8217;s good fun.</p>
<p>Over the next little while, I will endeavor to bring this blog back to glory!  Be sure to follow me on <a href="http://twiter.com/CWTwist" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/CWTwist" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, or<a href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"> Tumblr</a>, to be notified the moment this thing goes back online.  I wish you a glorious day, and a bright future to come.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, check out these lovely little broaches!  Aren&#8217;t they just delightful?  Not too ostentatious, just enough elements to be visually quite fascinating, clever asymmetry, I approve!  And I want one, lol.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/buttonsnbobbin" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/t1.0-9/10478185_900963199919730_8198733204758411731_n.jpg" alt="" width="730" height="548" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out my friend <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/buttonsnbobbin" target="_blank">Pun&#8217;s Etsy</a> for ordering details.  We just met at Clockwork Alchemy, in California, and hit if off right away.  But when she said &#8220;oh, yeah, I&#8217;m making some broaches&#8230;&#8221; I didn&#8217;t realize they would turn out to be this lovely!  I suppose, I should have.  Sorry, Pun!</p>
<p>Join me now and support the little guy!  &#8230;or, girl, in this case.  Check out her <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/buttonsnbobbin" target="_blank">Etsy</a>, and share her art.</p>

<p>Anyway, yes!  Twist will be making an appearance at this year&#8217;s Clockwork Alchemy con, in San Jose, California, from May 23rd through 26th.  Just like last year, I&#8217;ll be signing books at the table, and selling swag.  I&#8217;ll have the first 2 books on sale, and even some new shiny buttons.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-2279" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140519_123740.jpg" alt="20140519_123740" width="252" height="189" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140519_123740.jpg 3264w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140519_123740-300x225.jpg 300w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140519_123740-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" />If you&#8217;re in the San Jose area and like a bit of steampunk, come in for the day!  There&#8217;ll be musical and special guests, lots of things to buy with gears glued on, weirdos&#8211;erm&#8230;  I mean, wonderfully attired individuals, and a library of all things steampunk with loads of authors and book signings!</p>
<p>Of course, you know, I won&#8217;t get to see much of the con myself, as I&#8217;ll be mostly at my author table.  So, please do come and say hi!  It would be lovely to chat with you.  And if you come in costume, I&#8217;ll be taking as many pictures as I can and posting them all right here on the blog!  I had a lovely time meeting a lot of you last year, and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing you again.</p>

<p>Once again, the works you will find in this volume are all of a classical style.  There are no confusing prose, or ostentatious turns of phrase.  These are poems that echo the more refined and understandable rhymes and rhythms of Emily Dickinson and Poe, but with JaniceT&#8217;s own unique voice.</p>
<p>I find that much of modern poetry is aloof and self-important, as if the work itself were looking down its nose at me with judgmental eyes, assuming that I could never truly understand its so-called greatness.  Others are so rough and simplistic as to make me wonder why it&#8217;s called a poem at all, and not simply a very short essay.  Slam poets can reach me once in a while, but usually I&#8217;m off-put by their aggressive shouts and clear intent to offend.  Either way, I always end up going back to the more inviting, delightful, and damned understandable works of old, where I can enjoy a moment of truth and beautiful melancholy with Yeats, or dance happily through the clean air with Shelly and his skylarks.</p>
<p>Because of all of this, I&#8217;m very happy to announce that JaniceT&#8217;s work is something anyone can easily relate to and enjoy.  She took great care and attention to give these pieces rhyme and structures that are familiar and comforting, while bringing up many new and fascinating ideas.  She writes both about the modern condition with poems about organic foods and on-line trolls, as well as venturing farther into Steampunk than before with airships and a delightful look at Verne.  All the while, you will find graceful moments of relateable human experience and true emotion.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re put-off by poetry in general, or feel that you just don&#8217;t get it, then do yourself a favor and give this one poet a try.  These poems will welcome you in with open arms, and show you that this art form really is one that you too can deeply enjoy.  You were simply reading the wrong poems, all along.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sure, we all talk about the great Victorian novels, but how often do we Steampunks really sit down and read them?  We&#8217;re all so busy sewing, writing, reading modern Steampunk, larping and making, who&#8217;s got the time to read the classics?  Well, I do.  If you manage to carve out a few hours for a proper novel and a cup of tea, then check over this list to see if you missed any essentials.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="http://worldsoccertalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/old-books.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="228" /></p>
<h4>1, Around the World in 80 Days,  Jules Verne.</h4>
<p>That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m on Team Verne.  Sorry Wells, but Verne is just more fun.  When I first realized that Steampunk was a genre, this was the first book I ever read specifically looking for Steampunk inspiration.  I gobbled it up in one breath and was inspired enough to start writing my own Steampunk adventures.  This book has it all: fantastic and unique characters, exotic destinations, Victorian social commentary, and enough humor, adventure, and excitement to delight anyone.  And for those of you who think, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve seen the movie.  I don&#8217;t need to read it,&#8221; I will tell you that you&#8217;re utterly wrong!  First of all, there&#8217;s no balloon in the book.  Second, I have never seen a decent portrayal of Passepartout in any film or show.  And lastly, although one actor has played Phileas with dignity, none have ever truly captured the damn sexy subtlety of his true nature.  If you adore gentlemanly adventure like any good Steampunk, and you haven&#8217;t read this book, then you are doing yourself a great disservice.</p>
<h4>2. The Time Machine, H.G. Wells</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t take my siding with Verne as an insult to Wells.  Even though a great deal of his novels were bridging past the Victorian era, The Time Machine is as much a part of Steampunk lore as goggles and airships.  This book has the Dystopian edge that permeates modern Steampunk, and more metaphorical social commentary than you can shake a stick at.  While I personally prefer more layered characters, I can say nothing at all against Wells&#8217;s skill in storytelling.  I would say that the movie (the original, not that weird thing from the 90s) did a better job of portraying the story in the way that it was written, and any movies based on Verne.  Even so, this great work deserves to be read.</p>
<h4>3. The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde.</h4>
<p>Ah, Wilde&#8230;  I&#8217;ve had a literary crush on the work of Oscar Wilde since I was in my teens.  It usually takes me twice as long as normal to finish one of his stories, simply because I keep having to gasp, pause, and re-read every gorgeous line I find &#8230; which is usually about every-other one.  But wait! you say.  Wilde didn&#8217;t write about submarines or airship travel, or time machines!  No, he didn&#8217;t.  He wrote of men&#8217;s true nature and the murky, shadowed depths of the human soul.  In this glorious novel, Wilde explored the dangers of the ego-centered detachment, which the wealthy and the beautiful London aristocrats danced so blindly about.  Here in 2014, it can be difficult to get a clear perspective of what life was really like back there.  If you want to know the motivations of a Londoner of the time, feel the eerie quiet of an empty life in a grand old house, and taste the terror of one&#8217;s own limitless potential in a world of too much freedom, than you will find no better prorate.</p>
<h4>4. A Study in Scarlet, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</h4>
<p>More than just taking us through wonderfully entertaining stories about murder and mystery, Watson provides another great snapshot of what life was like under the rule of Victoria.  From mentioning popular culture (like novels that were once wildly popular but are now unheard of, and which plays, operas, and even fashions were popular at the time) to noting that the sky over London is rather brown today, Watson weaves a tapestry of the time.  The way that the two characters relate to their world in the original stories, tells more than you will ever find on Wiki, or in any of the TV shows and movies that have been made from it.  Not that there is anything wrong with SherlockBBC.  I was simply staggered by the bulk of raw insight that I found in all of the Holmes stories.</p>
<h4>5. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Jules Verne</h4>
<p>I mean really.  How could this book NOT be on any steampunk list?  Sure, there&#8217;s more fish genus than are at all needed.  Sure, Nemo&#8217;s past is never truly explored.  Sure, Ned can be a bit annoying.  But honestly, what would our beloved genre be with this massively inventive, thrillingly adventurous, and truly beautiful work?  All I can say is that, as with most of Verne&#8217;s works, you must be very careful when selecting a translation to read.  The first time I tried to read this book, I couldn&#8217;t get more than a few pages in before I got bored.  But, I found out later that I had been reading a highly abridged version, with truly awful re-writing.  I tried a much more modern translation by <span style="color:#222222;">Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, and suddenly I couldn&#8217;t put the book down!  I tell you right now, if you ever tried to read this book and didn&#8217;t like it, it was entirely because of the translation.  Get a better copy and try it again today!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;</p>
<p>Well, that my top 5 classic Victorian essentials list.  What&#8217;s yours?  Do you agree with my line up?  Did I missing something dreadfully important to the genre?  Leave a comment and let me know your thoughts.  And happy reading!</p>
