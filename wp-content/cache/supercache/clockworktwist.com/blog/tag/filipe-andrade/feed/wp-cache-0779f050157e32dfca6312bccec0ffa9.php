										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled upon something quite interesting on Twitter, on Wednesday.  The nerdy powerhouse, <a href="http://geekandsundry.com/" target="_blank">Geek &amp; Sundry</a> started a Twitter tag chat thing (still learning my terms&#8230;) <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23ComicChat&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">#ComicChat</a> with writer <a href="http://www.jimzub.com/bio/" target="_blank">Jim Zub</a>, about a fun looking comic called Figment, that will be released this summer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://geekandsundry.com/view/first-look-disney-kingdoms-newest-comic" target="_blank"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.geekandsundry.com/assets/images/episodes/disney-figment-header.jpg" width="640" height="390" /></a></p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that image just inspire curiosity?  The story of this 5-part comic will center around two characters from a Disney Epcot ride, Journey Into Imagination, called Figment and Dreamfinder.  I&#8217;ve never been to the park myself, but these two look wonderfully interesting.</p>
<p>According to the Disney Wikia: &#8220;Dreamfinder was a character created by Walt Disney Imagineering. He created Figment, a tiny royal purple dragon made of two tiny wings, big yellow eyes, horns of a steer, the body of a lizard and a nose of a crocodile, plus a dash of childish delight. He teaches Figment about the wonders of imagination and takes riders along through all of Figment&#8217;s overdone splendors in his machine&#8217;s Idea Bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Jim said on Twitter, this comic &#8220;has an Oz, Little Nemo, fantastical steampunk approach.&#8221;  To which I reply, shut up and take my money!  As little info as there is on this comic, I&#8217;m already stoked and can&#8217;t wait to follow the adventures of Figment, the child-like purple dragon, and Dreamfinder, the &#8220;steampunk stud&#8221; as Jim called him.</p>
<p>Jim was nice enough to answer all sorts of interesting questions with the <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23ComicChat&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">#ComicChat</a> tag.  He&#8217;s a well established writer, with many a comic under his belt.  Check out his site for <a href="http://www.jimzub.com/category/tutorial/" target="_blank">writing tutorials</a>, FAQs about the <a href="http://www.jimzub.com/comic-qa-rates-cons-and-distrubution/" target="_blank">comic industry</a>, and more!  You can even read some of his digital comics on <a href="http://www.comixology.com/Jim-Zub/comics-creator/6195" target="_blank">comixology.com</a>.  He recommends <a href="http://www.comixology.com/Skullkickers/comics-series/4764" target="_blank">Skullkickers</a>.</p>
<p>As for the artist, Filipe Andrade has worked with Marvel on loads of different comics.  You can find more information on him on his blog.  And here&#8217;s one of my favorite images from one of his other projects.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://filipeandradeart.blogspot.pt/" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/0c02ed983f309e9d572df2414b38fb61/tumblr_n0cko4zzJw1qzrurbo1_500.jpg" width="500" height="707" /></a></p>
<p>All in all, this comic looks nothing but good.  Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/JimZub" target="_blank">@JimZub</a> on Twitter, or keep an eye on this blog for updates.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be doing a review as soon as I get my own copy.</p>

<p>Are you an author who loves Steampunk as much as I do?   Or, are you just a big big fan of a Steampunk/Neo-Victorian author?  Would you like to see  your favorite book, or your own book, featured on this blog?  Please leave a comment on this post with a short pitch and a link!   I’ll happily feature anything that I think will fit the style of my blog.  And even if I don’t feature it, please please leave your info in a comment anyway!  Who doesn’t love new books?</p>
