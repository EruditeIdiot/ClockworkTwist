										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello lovelies.  Some of you might be aware that I just moved across two states, and have also been wrestling with a multitude of personal dramas.  I don’t want to bore you with details of any of that, but simply explain my silence.</p>
<p>But as of today I’m moved in, most of my demons are trapped in warded circles in the basement, and the rest can bloody well queue up and wait to be dealt with.  I hope to return to regular posts both of the pretty steampunk/reading nooks/pocket watches variety, but also of these new shorter little essays.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I’m not a blogger at heart.  My writing tendencies are much better tuned to banging out long series of novels and less to being social in any way.  But, as much as I’m sure I’d make an excellent hermit and happily continue to write to no one in particular, I realized that I should probably give it another go.</p>
<p>So, here I am, giving it another go.  If you have any tips for a victim of social media anxiety disorder, I’d be glad to hear them.  I promise I’ll try very hard not to run away if you talk to me.</p>
