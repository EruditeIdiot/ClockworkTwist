					<description><![CDATA[Team Verne all the way! I must say I liked ALL the movies. Likewise &#039;20,000 Leagues&#039;. &#039;The League Of Extraordinary Gentleman&#039; was a good but weird homage and made a weirder movie, but both correctly showed Nemo as a revolutionary Indian prince, which was apparently Verne&#039;s original intention, despite his Anglophilia elsewhere. Amen to your other choices too.
