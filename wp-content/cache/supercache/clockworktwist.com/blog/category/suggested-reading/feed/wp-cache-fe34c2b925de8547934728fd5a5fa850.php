										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wing-Dare-Flying-Horse-Books-ebook/dp/B00B3OF412/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1356997109l/14741800.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="362" /></a>I was lucky enough to meet Linda Ulleseit, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wing-Dare-Flying-Horse-Books-ebook/dp/B00B3OF412/" target="_blank">On a Wing and a Dare</a>, at a local author event last year.  Since then, she has been a gracious supporter of <a title="Book one : Waking" href="/waking/" target="_blank">my series</a>, while I&#8217;ve failed utterly to return the favor.  Now, I have FINALLY gotten a spare moment to give the first book in her <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/102454-flying-horse-books" target="_blank">Flying Horse Books</a> series a good read, and I&#8217;m so glad that I did!</p>
<p>The story takes place in a mythical and equine-centric version Whales (which is plenty of reason for me to like it right away, but more on that later) where the best job in the world is to be a flying-horse rider for one of the most prominent barns.  These daring riders compete in aerial games of skill on their beautiful winged steeds, to adoration and fame.  But, despite the fact that two of the most powerful barns have been grumbling through a feud for generations, the children of these two barns are the best of friends.  Poor Emma, the charming and precocious daughter of Hoel&#8217;s barn, has her heart set on her childhood friend, Even, the handsome eldest son of Morgan&#8217;s barn.  Meanwhile, Davyd, Even&#8217;s darling and clever younger brother, is also a close friend to Emma and has developed his own feeling for her, as well.  Amid this already complex social situation, the winged horses are suddenly falling ill from a mysterious sickness.  Will Hoel and Morgan put their differences aside for the sake of their horses?  Will Emma ever be free to marry the man she truly loves?  Will sweet little Davyd ever catch a break??  You&#8217;ll just have to read for yourself to find out!</p>
<p>First of all, I have to say that I was sucked into the world of this story right away.  This is partly because, like many silly Americans, I often internally glamorize my English, Scottish, and Welsh roots, and lament never having the chance to visit much of the homeland.  Just as I&#8217;d hoped when first hearing that Whales was the setting of the story, Linda&#8217;s writing is flush with atmospheric details of the lofty mountains, the rolling green hills, and the wild winds.  I was delighted by how easily I found myself transported into such a vivid world.  Linda also used Welsh language in the dialog, which added a lovely flavor without ever being excluding to someone (like me) who has no knowledge of the language.  Instead, the meaning of every phrase was easy to deduce, or swiftly explained, with expert ease.  The details of the environments were also not too numerous to feel forced, but came off as natural and earnest, which can sometimes be rather rare in modern writing.</p>
<p>Aside from the beautiful backdrop of the story, the characters were all very well defined and interesting.  I found myself enjoying poor tortured Davyd most of all, who is expected to be a great flying-horse rider like his brother and everyone else in his family, but is terrified of heights.  How can you not instantly feel for the boy?  As Davyd struggled with his shameful secret of not actually wanting to be a rider, while also trying to reconcile his brand new feeling for his oldest friend, and nearly singlehandedly administrate the arrangements for a massive event like the annual aerial games in the midst of a equine health crisis, I found myself only caring more and more for him.  But even with my preference, I must admit that each character had a surprising amount of depth, roundness, and charming understandably.  All but Tristain, who&#8217;s really just a jerk.  But then, the strength of my dislike for him is only a credit to the author.  Love and hate both require equal skill to produce in a reader.</p>
<p>So, if you can&#8217;t afford a vacation to Whales, or if you just want to read a well written, exciting, and truly charming book, then I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wing-Dare-Flying-Horse-Books-ebook/dp/B00B3OF412/" target="_blank">On a Wing and a Dare</a>.  I never thought I would so enjoy a YA book about flying horses, and I&#8217;m delighted to find that I was so wrong.  I can&#8217;t wait to read the rest of the series as well!  Even if this story isn&#8217;t your usual genre, trust me.  It&#8217;s worth giving it a try.</p>
<p>Get the eBook  on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wing-Dare-Flying-Horse-Books-ebook/dp/B00B3OF412/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, or on <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/282169" target="_blank">Smashwords</a>.  Only $2.99!  The paperback is also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wing-Dare-Flying-Horse-Books-ebook/dp/B00B3OF412/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>See?  I told you it wasn&#8217;t all gonna be steampunk now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Maltese-Falcon-Dashiell-Hammett/dp/0679722645"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/MainTitle2MaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg" alt="Thanks, Wiki Commons!" width="455" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>I adore classic lit.  If they&#8217;ve made a massively iconic film of it in the 30s &#8211; 60s, if it appears on the &#8220;100 books to read before you die&#8221; lists, if I can find a battered old paperback of it that&#8217;s older than I am, I want to read it.  I think that tendency comes partly from the fact that I didn&#8217;t go to a typical high school.  As a kid, I was never forced to read anything, but my family and friend made the classics sound grand, beautiful, and mysterious.  Once I got a taste for them, I now always look to the past to find something great to read.</p>
<p>This month, I read The Maltese Falcon by Hammett.  I read The Thin Man earlier, and loved it, so why not try the big one?  Well, let me tell you, diving into Hammett&#8217;s world of noir isn&#8217;t like watching the movies.  Now, I love a Boggie movie any day, and William Powell is precisely what I look for in a man, so don&#8217;t get me wrong.  I love the movies that they&#8217;ve done with Hammett&#8217;s books, but the two versions are drastically different for many reasons.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/TypeHype1MaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="207" />First and foremost, Hammett&#8217;s writing style is singular.  I&#8217;ve read Chandler and others in the &#8220;hardball PI&#8221; genre, but I&#8217;ve never read anything like Hammett.  Reading this book, I was stunned by the fact that Sam Spades&#8217;s actions were never explained at all.  He often did things that confused me, or seemed unfeeling and cruel, and I was never given a single moment of explanation or excuse.  When Sherlock Holmes goes out in a hurry dressed at a vicar, and then comes home covered in blood at 3am, he always has a chance to explain what happened, and how it will help his case.  This is not the case with Sam Spade.  I was left with a vague uneasiness as I tried to guess his reasoning, and honestly, I find the man to be nearly as off-putting and frightening as Uriah Heep.</p>
<p>But even with this lack of explanation and emotional connection to the character, I couldn&#8217;t say that Sam didn&#8217;t feel completely real to me.  In fact, he felt more solid, whole, and real to me because he acted so independently, and because he was so damned unnerving.  Reading about him was like following a sociopath around all day.  When I re-watched the movie recently, I was stunned by how intrinsically likable and sympathetic the character became in Bogart&#8217;s hands.  The Sam of the movie and the Sam of the book are vastly different people, and I&#8217;m glad they are.  While I&#8217;m sitting here in awe of the response Hammett was able to get from me, I honestly don&#8217;t believe that the movie would have become such an icon if Boggie hadn&#8217;t played him the way he did.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/GutmanCairoMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg" alt="" width="319" height="239" />Other than Sam, there were a lot of differences between the movie that we all know, and the book that few have actually read.  One thing that surprised me was the clear evidence that Joel Cairo was meant to be gay.  However, nothing was said outright about it, and Joel wasn&#8217;t treated like any more of a caricature than the other characters.  He was simply more interested in the young gunman than he was in Bridget, which explained why she wasn&#8217;t able to seduce him the way she could with every other man she met.  Considering the times, I can easily understand why all of those tells were removed from the script.  It only makes the book that much more edgy for it&#8217;s time, which it was clearly meant to be.</p>
<p>Another thing that I found incredible about this book was the fact that no one in it ever said what they meant, and yet I was able to understand their true intentions easily.  Everyone, of course, but Sam who confused me consistently.  That kind of writing is risky because it&#8217;s easy for the reader to miss what&#8217;s really going on.  I really respect Hammett&#8217;s confidence to keep to this style, without a moment of hesitation.  Although most people in The Thin Man said exactly what they meant, in that book Hammett employed an equally brazen style that could have&#8211;but didn&#8217;t&#8211;go horribly wrong.  I get the feeling that each on of his books was an experiment in pushing the limits of writing.</p>
<p>In the end, I&#8217;m very happy I actually read this book, instead of just watching the movie.  I feel like I learned a lot about humanity, greed, desperation, and the high-art of writing a damn good book.  If you haven&#8217;t read this one, grab a copy and start reading it today.  Every second-hand bookshop in town is bound to have a few dog-eared copies on the shelf.</p>

<p>Once again, the works you will find in this volume are all of a classical style.  There are no confusing prose, or ostentatious turns of phrase.  These are poems that echo the more refined and understandable rhymes and rhythms of Emily Dickinson and Poe, but with JaniceT&#8217;s own unique voice.</p>
<p>I find that much of modern poetry is aloof and self-important, as if the work itself were looking down its nose at me with judgmental eyes, assuming that I could never truly understand its so-called greatness.  Others are so rough and simplistic as to make me wonder why it&#8217;s called a poem at all, and not simply a very short essay.  Slam poets can reach me once in a while, but usually I&#8217;m off-put by their aggressive shouts and clear intent to offend.  Either way, I always end up going back to the more inviting, delightful, and damned understandable works of old, where I can enjoy a moment of truth and beautiful melancholy with Yeats, or dance happily through the clean air with Shelly and his skylarks.</p>
<p>Because of all of this, I&#8217;m very happy to announce that JaniceT&#8217;s work is something anyone can easily relate to and enjoy.  She took great care and attention to give these pieces rhyme and structures that are familiar and comforting, while bringing up many new and fascinating ideas.  She writes both about the modern condition with poems about organic foods and on-line trolls, as well as venturing farther into Steampunk than before with airships and a delightful look at Verne.  All the while, you will find graceful moments of relateable human experience and true emotion.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re put-off by poetry in general, or feel that you just don&#8217;t get it, then do yourself a favor and give this one poet a try.  These poems will welcome you in with open arms, and show you that this art form really is one that you too can deeply enjoy.  You were simply reading the wrong poems, all along.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sure, we all talk about the great Victorian novels, but how often do we Steampunks really sit down and read them?  We&#8217;re all so busy sewing, writing, reading modern Steampunk, larping and making, who&#8217;s got the time to read the classics?  Well, I do.  If you manage to carve out a few hours for a proper novel and a cup of tea, then check over this list to see if you missed any essentials.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="http://worldsoccertalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/old-books.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="228" /></p>
<h4>1, Around the World in 80 Days,  Jules Verne.</h4>
<p>That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m on Team Verne.  Sorry Wells, but Verne is just more fun.  When I first realized that Steampunk was a genre, this was the first book I ever read specifically looking for Steampunk inspiration.  I gobbled it up in one breath and was inspired enough to start writing my own Steampunk adventures.  This book has it all: fantastic and unique characters, exotic destinations, Victorian social commentary, and enough humor, adventure, and excitement to delight anyone.  And for those of you who think, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve seen the movie.  I don&#8217;t need to read it,&#8221; I will tell you that you&#8217;re utterly wrong!  First of all, there&#8217;s no balloon in the book.  Second, I have never seen a decent portrayal of Passepartout in any film or show.  And lastly, although one actor has played Phileas with dignity, none have ever truly captured the damn sexy subtlety of his true nature.  If you adore gentlemanly adventure like any good Steampunk, and you haven&#8217;t read this book, then you are doing yourself a great disservice.</p>
<h4>2. The Time Machine, H.G. Wells</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t take my siding with Verne as an insult to Wells.  Even though a great deal of his novels were bridging past the Victorian era, The Time Machine is as much a part of Steampunk lore as goggles and airships.  This book has the Dystopian edge that permeates modern Steampunk, and more metaphorical social commentary than you can shake a stick at.  While I personally prefer more layered characters, I can say nothing at all against Wells&#8217;s skill in storytelling.  I would say that the movie (the original, not that weird thing from the 90s) did a better job of portraying the story in the way that it was written, and any movies based on Verne.  Even so, this great work deserves to be read.</p>
<h4>3. The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde.</h4>
<p>Ah, Wilde&#8230;  I&#8217;ve had a literary crush on the work of Oscar Wilde since I was in my teens.  It usually takes me twice as long as normal to finish one of his stories, simply because I keep having to gasp, pause, and re-read every gorgeous line I find &#8230; which is usually about every-other one.  But wait! you say.  Wilde didn&#8217;t write about submarines or airship travel, or time machines!  No, he didn&#8217;t.  He wrote of men&#8217;s true nature and the murky, shadowed depths of the human soul.  In this glorious novel, Wilde explored the dangers of the ego-centered detachment, which the wealthy and the beautiful London aristocrats danced so blindly about.  Here in 2014, it can be difficult to get a clear perspective of what life was really like back there.  If you want to know the motivations of a Londoner of the time, feel the eerie quiet of an empty life in a grand old house, and taste the terror of one&#8217;s own limitless potential in a world of too much freedom, than you will find no better prorate.</p>
<h4>4. A Study in Scarlet, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</h4>
<p>More than just taking us through wonderfully entertaining stories about murder and mystery, Watson provides another great snapshot of what life was like under the rule of Victoria.  From mentioning popular culture (like novels that were once wildly popular but are now unheard of, and which plays, operas, and even fashions were popular at the time) to noting that the sky over London is rather brown today, Watson weaves a tapestry of the time.  The way that the two characters relate to their world in the original stories, tells more than you will ever find on Wiki, or in any of the TV shows and movies that have been made from it.  Not that there is anything wrong with SherlockBBC.  I was simply staggered by the bulk of raw insight that I found in all of the Holmes stories.</p>
<h4>5. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Jules Verne</h4>
<p>I mean really.  How could this book NOT be on any steampunk list?  Sure, there&#8217;s more fish genus than are at all needed.  Sure, Nemo&#8217;s past is never truly explored.  Sure, Ned can be a bit annoying.  But honestly, what would our beloved genre be with this massively inventive, thrillingly adventurous, and truly beautiful work?  All I can say is that, as with most of Verne&#8217;s works, you must be very careful when selecting a translation to read.  The first time I tried to read this book, I couldn&#8217;t get more than a few pages in before I got bored.  But, I found out later that I had been reading a highly abridged version, with truly awful re-writing.  I tried a much more modern translation by <span style="color:#222222;">Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, and suddenly I couldn&#8217;t put the book down!  I tell you right now, if you ever tried to read this book and didn&#8217;t like it, it was entirely because of the translation.  Get a better copy and try it again today!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;</p>
<p>Well, that my top 5 classic Victorian essentials list.  What&#8217;s yours?  Do you agree with my line up?  Did I missing something dreadfully important to the genre?  Leave a comment and let me know your thoughts.  And happy reading!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled upon something quite interesting on Twitter, on Wednesday.  The nerdy powerhouse, <a href="http://geekandsundry.com/" target="_blank">Geek &amp; Sundry</a> started a Twitter tag chat thing (still learning my terms&#8230;) <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23ComicChat&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">#ComicChat</a> with writer <a href="http://www.jimzub.com/bio/" target="_blank">Jim Zub</a>, about a fun looking comic called Figment, that will be released this summer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://geekandsundry.com/view/first-look-disney-kingdoms-newest-comic" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.geekandsundry.com/assets/images/episodes/disney-figment-header.jpg" width="640" height="390" /></a></p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that image just inspire curiosity?  The story of this 5-part comic will center around two characters from a Disney Epcot ride, Journey Into Imagination, called Figment and Dreamfinder.  I&#8217;ve never been to the park myself, but these two look wonderfully interesting.</p>
<p>According to the Disney Wikia: &#8220;Dreamfinder was a character created by Walt Disney Imagineering. He created Figment, a tiny royal purple dragon made of two tiny wings, big yellow eyes, horns of a steer, the body of a lizard and a nose of a crocodile, plus a dash of childish delight. He teaches Figment about the wonders of imagination and takes riders along through all of Figment&#8217;s overdone splendors in his machine&#8217;s Idea Bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Jim said on Twitter, this comic &#8220;has an Oz, Little Nemo, fantastical steampunk approach.&#8221;  To which I reply, shut up and take my money!  As little info as there is on this comic, I&#8217;m already stoked and can&#8217;t wait to follow the adventures of Figment, the child-like purple dragon, and Dreamfinder, the &#8220;steampunk stud&#8221; as Jim called him.</p>
<p>Jim was nice enough to answer all sorts of interesting questions with the <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23ComicChat&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">#ComicChat</a> tag.  He&#8217;s a well established writer, with many a comic under his belt.  Check out his site for <a href="http://www.jimzub.com/category/tutorial/" target="_blank">writing tutorials</a>, FAQs about the <a href="http://www.jimzub.com/comic-qa-rates-cons-and-distrubution/" target="_blank">comic industry</a>, and more!  You can even read some of his digital comics on <a href="http://www.comixology.com/Jim-Zub/comics-creator/6195" target="_blank">comixology.com</a>.  He recommends <a href="http://www.comixology.com/Skullkickers/comics-series/4764" target="_blank">Skullkickers</a>.</p>
<p>As for the artist, Filipe Andrade has worked with Marvel on loads of different comics.  You can find more information on him on his blog.  And here&#8217;s one of my favorite images from one of his other projects.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://filipeandradeart.blogspot.pt/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/0c02ed983f309e9d572df2414b38fb61/tumblr_n0cko4zzJw1qzrurbo1_500.jpg" width="500" height="707" /></a></p>
<p>All in all, this comic looks nothing but good.  Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/JimZub" target="_blank">@JimZub</a> on Twitter, or keep an eye on this blog for updates.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be doing a review as soon as I get my own copy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mapoftimebook.com/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1300487687l/9766078.jpg" width="220" height="333" /></a>I want you to take a moment, and breath in a lung-full of air.  Savor the taste of it.  Notice that it&#8217;s ordinary, clean of the ozone-spark of anything like magic.  And now that you know what you&#8217;ll be leaving behind, let me introduce you to something truly magnificent.</p>
<p>The Map of Time, by Felix J. Palma is without a doubt, the best thing I&#8217;ve ever read.  It&#8217;s not a classic (yet), it&#8217;s not Poe, or Dickens, or Wilde, and it&#8217;s certainly not flawless, but it is still the very best.  Let me attempt to explain what I mean.</p>
<p>Rather than listing all of the ways this book is exceptional, first let&#8217;s take a look at what&#8217;s wrong with it.  Palma breaks loads of literary rules.  There are more red-herrings than I can count.  He uses real, dead human beings as characters.  He makes fun of Terminator in the middle of the Victorian era.  He&#8217;s writing in Spanish, but writing exclusively about English people.  He switches POV whenever it suits him.  He smashes the 4th wall to bits so frequently that I got used to it, and made fun of his own novel, inside of his own novel!  And yet&#8230;  When he breaks these ancient rules, he does it with such grace and smug brilliance that I not only forgave him for it, but I wanted to thank him for his bravery and for proving that it could be done.</p>
<p>I fell in love with this book on the first page.  I had no idea what was in store for me (or H.G.Wells) when I read that first page, but I could smell the magic.  But it&#8217;s not just the first page.  Every character in this massive tome (I recommend the eBook simply so that the book is physically manageable) is treated with near-Vernian compassion, which gives them all a full life of their own.  The plot is revealed in endless layer upon layer, each one perfectly plausible at the time and yet obviously ridiculous once you see the next.  The actual events are dense and complexly connected, and yet there is always time to sit down with the Elephant Man for tea, and learn through sublime implications just how human he really is.  How human we all are.</p>
<p>This book is a treasure trove of delight and beauty.  There&#8217;s something wonderfully clever around every corner, and something honest, raw, and bittersweet tucking into every silence.  There were moments, when reading this, that I honestly could not put the book down (even if I was supposed to be working, or I was starting to run late for my appointment) because I felt that electric tingle in my blood that always tells you: Stop.  This is rare.  This is something worth being late for.  This, right here, is going to change your world and make it a little wider &#8230; even if just by a little.</p>
<p>I should, also, mention that there are actual flaws that I can&#8217;t exactly excuse.  There seems to be no filtering when it comes to &#8220;romance&#8221; or gruesome violence.  Although they are few, some of the scenes are so unexpectedly detailed, and yet surrounded by such charming passages, that I felt they were incongruous with the rest of the book.  And so, as much as I&#8217;d like to, I can&#8217;t recommend this book to anyone under-aged or easily offended.  I noticed many, many, typos throughout the book, probably due to the fact that it was translated from Spanish to English and is longer than Harry Potter.  And yet&#8230;  I found I could forgive Palma all of this, easily.  I guess, in this case, an overwhelming amount of good really can outweigh the bad.</p>
<p>Now, I will not tell you what this book is about.  If I did, it would spoil so many wonderful moments.  So, you&#8217;re just going to have to take my word for it.  If you&#8217;re fine with your air the way it is, then go read something else.  But, if you&#8217;re like me and you prefer your air scented with a hint of magic crackling in the corners, then I have just the book for you.</p>
<p>Try the official first Chapter excerpt <a href="http://mapoftimebook.com/assets/pdf/Map-of-Time-Chapter1-excerpt.pdf" target="_blank">right here</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the coming ghouls and ghosties, that new chill in the air, pumpkin flavored everything, and nature dressed all in her best colors, I thought that this month I&#8217;d give you a truly creepy tale from the grand master of horror himself.  But when I looked at the sheer number of amazing stories on offer, I was overwhelmed.  How do you pick ONE great story out of so many?  Then, I remembered my very favorite story by our lovely Poe.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of God, Montresor&#8230;!!&#8221;  Ah!  Wonderful.  It&#8217;s got costumes, dark catacombs, and murderous intent.  Perfect for Halloween!  Sure, it might not be the scariest Poe story, but I think it&#8217;s one of the very best.  If you&#8217;ve never read it, you must read it this instant!  If you have read it before, wallow in the nostalgic awesome with me.</p>
<p>This was actually the first Poe story that I ever read myself, when I was about 12 or 13.  If I&#8217;m perfectly honest, reading these masterful, dreadful, brilliant words had a huge influence on me.  Young little me, my eyes alight with true wonder, vowed that day to write something even half as good, even if it took the rest of my life.  And I&#8217;m still striving for that same goal today.  Enjoy!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO<br />
by Edgar Allan Poe</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span id="more-767"></span></p>
<pre>  THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could,
but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well
know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that gave
utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a
point definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which
it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish but
punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution
overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger
fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.
  It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given
Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my in to
smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my to smile now was at
the thought of his immolation.
  He had a weak point --this Fortunato --although in other regards
he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his
connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.
For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and
opportunity, to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian
millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,
was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this
respect I did not differ from him materially; --I was skilful in the
Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.
  It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the
carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with
excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore
motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head
was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see
him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.
  I said to him --"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How
remarkably well you are looking to-day. But I have received a pipe
of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts."
  "How?" said he. "Amontillado, A pipe? Impossible! And in the
middle of the carnival!"
  "I have my doubts," I replied; "and I was silly enough to pay the
full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You
were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain."
  "Amontillado!"
  "I have my doubts."
  "Amontillado!"
  "And I must satisfy them."
  "Amontillado!"
  "As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchresi. If any one has a
critical turn it is he. He will tell me --"
  "Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry."
  "And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for
your own.
  "Come, let us go."
  "Whither?"
  "To your vaults."
  "My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I
perceive you have an engagement. Luchresi--"
  "I have no engagement; --come."
  "My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with
which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably
damp. They are encrusted with nitre."
  "Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado!
You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish
Sherry from Amontillado."
  Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting on
a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person,
I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.
  There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry
in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return
until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from
the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure
their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was
turned.
  I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to
Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway
that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding
staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at
length to the foot of the descent, and stood together upon the damp
ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.
  The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap
jingled as he strode.
  "The pipe," he said.
  "It is farther on," said I; "but observe the white web-work which
gleams from these cavern walls."
  He turned towards me, and looked into my eves with two filmy orbs
that distilled the rheum of intoxication.
  "Nitre?" he asked, at length.
  "Nitre," I replied. "How long have you had that cough?"
  "Ugh! ugh! ugh! --ugh! ugh! ugh! --ugh! ugh! ugh! --ugh! ugh! ugh!
--ugh! ugh! ugh!"
  My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.
  "It is nothing," he said, at last.
  "Come," I said, with decision, "we will go back; your health is
precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as
once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We
will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides,
there is Luchresi --"
  "Enough," he said; "the cough's a mere nothing; it will not kill me.
I shall not die of a cough."
  "True --true," I replied; "and, indeed, I had no intention of
alarming you unnecessarily --but you should use all proper caution.
A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.
  Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row
of its fellows that lay upon the mould.
  "Drink," I said, presenting him the wine.
  He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me
familiarly, while his bells jingled.
  "I drink," he said, "to the buried that repose around us."
  "And I to your long life."
  He again took my arm, and we proceeded.
  "These vaults," he said, "are extensive."
  "The Montresors," I replied, "were a great and numerous family."
  "I forget your arms."
  "A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a
serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel."
  "And the motto?"
  "Nemo me impune lacessit."
  "Good!" he said.
  The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy
grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through long walls of piled
skeletons, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost
recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold
to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.
  "The nitre!" I said; "see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the
vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle
among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your
cough --"
  "It is nothing," he said; "let us go on. But first, another
draught of the Medoc."
  I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave. He emptied it at a
breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the
bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.
  I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement --a
grotesque one.
  "You do not comprehend?" he said.
  "Not I," I replied.
  "Then you are not of the brotherhood."
  "How?"
  "You are not of the masons."
  "Yes, yes," I said; "yes, yes."
  "You? Impossible! A mason?"
  "A mason," I replied.
  "A sign," he said, "a sign."
  "It is this," I answered, producing from beneath the folds of my
roquelaire a trowel.
  "You jest," he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. "But let us proceed
to the Amontillado."
  "Be it so," I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again
offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route
in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches,
descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt,
in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow
than flame.
  At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less
spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the
vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.
Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this
manner. From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay
promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some
size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones,
we perceived a still interior crypt or recess, in depth about four
feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been
constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the
interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the
catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of
solid granite.
  It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured
to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble
light did not enable us to see.
  "Proceed," I said; "herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchresi --"
  "He is an ignoramus," interrupted my friend, as he stepped
unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In
niche, and finding an instant he had reached the extremity of the
niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly
bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In
its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two
feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the
other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the
work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to
resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.
  "Pass your hand," I said, "over the wall; you cannot help feeling
the nitre. Indeed, it is very damp. Once more let me implore you to
return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first
render you all the little attentions in my power."
  "The Amontillado!" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from
his astonishment.
  "True," I replied; "the Amontillado."
  As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of
which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a
quantity of building stone and mortar. With these materials and with
the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of
the niche.
  I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I
discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure
worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning
cry from the depth of the recess. It was not the cry of a drunken man.
There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier,
and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations
of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that
I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my
labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking
subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption
the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly
upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux
over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.
  A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from
the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.
For a brief moment I hesitated, I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I
began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant
reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs,
and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of
him who clamoured. I re-echoed, I aided, I surpassed them in volume
and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.
  It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had
completed the eighth, the ninth and the tenth tier. I had finished a
portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single
stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I
placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came
from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It
was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as
that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said--
  "Ha! ha! ha! --he! he! he! --a very good joke, indeed --an excellent
jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo --he! he!
he! --over our wine --he! he! he!"
  "The Amontillado!" I said.
  "He! he! he! --he! he! he! --yes, the Amontillado. But is it not
getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady
Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone."
  "Yes," I said, "let us be gone."
  "For the love of God, Montresor!"
  "Yes," I said, "for the love of God!"
  But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew
impatient. I called aloud --
  "Fortunato!"
  No answer. I called again --
  "Fortunato!"
  No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and
let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of
the bells. My heart grew sick; it was the dampness of the catacombs
that made it so. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced
the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new
masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a
century no mortal has disturbed them. In pace requiescat!

                         -THE END-</pre>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, delicious friends!  Remember that awesome browser game I told you about?  Check out <a title="Anyone for a game? : Fallen London" href="http://clockworktwist.com/2013/07/29/anyone-for-a-game-fallen-london/" target="_blank">Fallen London</a> now, if you missed it.  Well, if you do remember, and fell as much in love with the game as I did, here&#8217;s a lovely little treat for you!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" alt="" src="http://th04.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2013/196/c/4/page_6_by_misterarendt-d6djug0.jpg" width="220" height="311" /></p>
<p>Failbetter is not only working on their new, non-browser PC game, <a href="http://sunlessseagame.com/" target="_blank">The Sunless Sea</a>, but on comics now as well.  Here&#8217;s a tantalizing little taste of the gruesome  and glorious work.</p>
<p><a href="http://comics.failbettergames.com/" target="_blank">A Pinch of Snuff</a> is a wonderful first taste of a comic series that is only just beginning.   It is dim, dank, and delectable.   The art by Paul Arendt is a perfect example of the sublime and shadowy beauty of Fallen London, while the story by Chris Gardiner is funny and sinister in all the right ways.</p>
<p>To be plainly honest with you, I want them to make more of this comic because I think it could be awesome.  So, please go read it, giggle, comment, and share!  If you have a gently dark sense of humor, or just like a bit of intrigue and bizarre, this little comic is sure to give you a chuckle.</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>Are you an author who loves Steampunk as much as I do?   Or, are you just a big big fan of a Steampunk/Neo-Victorian author?  Would you like to see  your favorite book, comic, or your own work featured on this blog?  Please leave a comment on this post with a short pitch and a link!   I’ll happily feature anything that I think will fit the style of my blog.  And even if I don’t feature it, please please leave your info in a comment anyway!  Who doesn’t love new books?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.slgcomic.com/assets/images/modela-frontcover--web.jpg" width="235" height="360" /></p>
<p>Have you ever laughed yourself silly watching an old Charlie Chaplin, or Buster Keaton clip?  Do you own robot toys?  Do you still watch Looney Tunes and giggle more than your kids do?  If you answered yes to any these questions, then boy oh boy, do I have a great little treat for you!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slgcomic.com/Model-A-Book-One_p_1967.html#" target="_blank">Model:A</a>, by Jef Bambas is the story of an obsolete and rather clumsy robot who breaks free of storage and accidentally blows up half the town as he tries to escape the newer models.  But unlike every other comic I&#8217;ve ever read, this one feels exactly like an old silent movie, without the the lame, tinny, piano music track.</p>
<p>There is no dialog whatsoever in this book, and true to classic <a href="http://www.slgcomic.com/" target="_blank">SLG </a>style, no color either.   What there is, however, is some of the best exaggerated motion, comedic timing, and snigger-inducing bad luck I&#8217;ve ever seen in any form of still artwork.  I&#8217;ve read through the first two books in the series and honestly, the single negative remark I can make about this comic that there isn&#8217;t nearly enough of it.</p>
<p>You can get the first section of book one for free (at the moment) at <a href="http://www.comixology.com/Model-A-1/digital-comic/25976" target="_blank">comixology.com</a>, but the full books one and two are available on-line at the links below.  I wish I had more links to share, but this thing is so small that I can&#8217;t find any.  I bought the books at a local art fair, directly from the artist.  Even though <a href="http://www.slgcomic.com/" target="_blank">SLG</a> is famous for giving<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhonen_Vasquez" target="_blank"> Jhonen Vasquez </a>his first break with <a href="http://jhonenvasquez.wikia.com/wiki/Johnny_the_Homicidal_Maniac" target="_blank">JtHM</a>, it&#8217;s still a smallish comic publisher.  I fear that this wonderful little gem could get lost without enough support.</p>
<p>So, give the book a read, giggle like a child, and then tell all your friends!  Let&#8217;s drag Model:A out of obscurity and get the artist to write more of it!  Are you with me?!</p>
<p>Get the first section for <a href="http://www.comixology.com/Model-A-1/digital-comic/25976" target="_blank">free</a>!</p>
<p>Buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Model-Book-One-Volume-Bambas/dp/1593622481" target="_blank">Book One</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Model-Book-Two-Jef-Bambas/dp/1593622503" target="_blank">Book Two</a> on Amazon.com,</p>
