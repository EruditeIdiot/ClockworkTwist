					<description><![CDATA[Yes, that&#8217;s right.  Tesla Death Ray.  Now, you know I love a good story and flashy graphics.  A quick scan of my blogs will show that right away.  But, that&#8217;s not to say that I don&#8217;t love a good mindless bit of fun from time to time.  This little flash game is just that: mindless, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.gpstudios.com/games/screenshots/tesla-death-ray-s2.jpg" width="280" height="220" />Yes, that&#8217;s right.  <a href="http://www.nsbrotherhood.com/games/tesladeathray.html" target="_blank">Tesla Death Ray</a>.  Now, you know I love a good story and flashy graphics.  A quick scan of my blogs will show that right away.  But, that&#8217;s not to say that I don&#8217;t love a good mindless bit of fun from time to time.  This little flash game is just that: mindless, simple, and really really fun.</p>
<p>The game is loosely based around the mythos of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank">my favorite emo inventor</a>.  The art style, while simple, has a great cartoon-dystopian look.   And the sound in this game is simply wonderful.  The zaps are crisp, the explosions really pop, and the screams of your victims are hilarious.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" alt="Nice guy Tesla" src="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/ff/fff70271a7124fb28b67995f7e7dabdb7beaa57cc4edb812d9c211b68fde4ed2.jpg" width="203" height="271" />The game is also very easy to play.  Simply click on the puny minions (probably Edison&#8217;s hit-men&#8230;) and watch them fry.   Then, use your winnings to make your Death Ray even more powerful and zap them all again!  Mwa-Hahahaha!!</p>
<p>So, whether you&#8217;re having a bad day and feel like blasting something, or just goofing around on the internet, take a second and try out this game.  It&#8217;s free, you know.  Why not?  It might just make you giggle.</p>
<h4>Enjoy, <a href="http://www.nsbrotherhood.com/games/tesladeathray.html" target="_blank">Tesla Death Ray</a> by <a href="http://nsbrotherhood.com/" target="_blank">NSbrotherhood</a>!</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;re 5 Mondays this month, so how about something different?  When I&#8217;m not writing, editing, reading, or painting, I&#8217;m most certainly gaming.  I love games of all sorts, and I always have.  So, here&#8217;s a steampunky game that I utterly adore!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://images.mmorpg.com/features/7108/images/fallenlondon2.jpg" width="270" height="210" /></p>
<p><a href="http://fallenlondon.storynexus.com/" target="_blank">Fallen London</a> (or Echo Bazaar) by <a href="http://about.failbettergames.com/" target="_blank">Failbetter Games</a> is one of my favorite games of all time.  It&#8217;s a free, browser based RPG that uses a card and action system.  The game play is simple and very easy to pick up, and the action system (10 usable actions that recharge over an hour or so of real time) keeps you from playing it for too long at once &#8230; which I do anyway.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the story that makes it marvelous.  Victorian London has been stolen by bats and stashed in a murky, shadowy underground world.  This beautifully Gothic and absinthe drowned city is densely populated by poets, jewel thieves, revolutionaries, secret societies led by cheesemongers, mysterious Masters of the Echo Bazaar, squid people, secret baring cats, and pirates of the Unterzee.  Each action you take in this game is presented as a tiny story, which often link together into grand adventures.  Even the items that you use for currency are things like whisper secrets, manic&#8217;s prayers, and stolen kisses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.gamesbrief.com/assets/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-18-at-10.53.08.png" width="165" height="325" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing this game for about 3 or 4 years now, off and on.  I&#8217;ve gained favor with the Empress, with my eurodite poetry and plays, and been gloriously banded from the court for being a literary badass unafraid of stodgy imperialists.  I married a jewel thief who showers my in diamonds and sometime we still go out snatching shiny things together.  I became an honored friend of the poets of Veilgarden and wrote a science fiction novel that shook the very foundation of Fallen London.  I&#8217;m friendly with the squid people, and I&#8217;ve tutored a golem into high society.  I also funded, built, and now captain my own Zubmarine on zailing adventures across the zeven zees.  Honestly, I hit the ceiling on this game about a year ago and had to wait for them to write more before I could play again.  But now, I&#8217;ve got a whole new bunch of stuff to do!</p>
<p>If you like steampunk, victoriana, great writing, and cheeky humor, you will love this fantastic game.  The art is great and very moody.  The characters are wonderful and surprisingly well rounded considering that you only see them in tiny story-lets.  Even the items you get to collect and use are clever and hilarious.  I once received a Counterfeit Head of John the Baptist which I&#8217;ve never used because it&#8217;s just too weird to be without.  I just can say enough about this game.</p>
