<p>Not to worry, though.  If these continue to sell well, I&#8217;ll just have to keep making more.  I&#8217;m also happy to do any sort of custom orders as well.  At the moment, my metal supplies are only of the same brass color, but I hope to branch out and try out some other antiqued metal colors as well.  Let me know in a comment if you have any suggestions.</p>
<p>And, of course, my very next design will be a replica of Twist&#8217;s watch from the books&#8230;  Keep an eye on this blog and my new store to see it as soon as I get it all put together!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I got creative today and decided to start a movement&#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-2220" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/first1.jpg" alt="first" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>This is the first draft of this image.  What do you think?  Did I miss any vital elements?  How do you like my font choices?  Is the balance all right?  Do you think it should say &#8220;before I knew it was a genre&#8221; instead, of can we just enjoy the self-righteousness?  Do you think I should I print some Tshirts?  I got the idea, talking with my Mom about our shared love of the genre.  She can claim to be a fan from well before the first appearances of the word &#8220;Steampunk&#8221; even appeared, but since I was born in the 80s, I can&#8217;t.  Even so, I&#8217;m always saying that I was a Steampunk way before I knew that was even a thing.  Here&#8217;s just a few examples of my world before I knew what the word &#8220;Steampunk&#8221; meant.</p>
<p>My favorite cartoon as a kid was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMzdEJOVj7Y" target="_blank">TaleSpin</a>: not Victorian, but filled with airship pirates.  My favorite movie has always been, and will always be, Fritz Lang&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us29EZ30nTc" target="_blank">Metropolis</a> (do yourself a favor and watch the Giorgio Moroder soundtrack version): Steam-powered dystopian paradise with a robot chick.  My favorite TV show was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105932/" target="_blank">Brisco County Jr</a>: basically a B-version of Aliens Vs Cowboys, with Bruce Campbell.  In my teens, I loved the <a href="http://www.gog.com/game/myst_masterpiece_edition" target="_blank">Myst</a> games so much that I learned how to write whole letters in the in-game language &#8220;Shorah!&#8221; and had a vast collection of ink-dip pens and parchment: heavens, what ISN&#8217;T Steampunk about those games?  And, just a few years before someone told me what Steampunk actually was, <a href="http://www.hulu.com/firefly" target="_blank">Firefly</a> captured my heart: You can&#8217;t take the sky from me&#8230;</p>
<p>Talking with other fans of the genre, I hear similar stories frequently.   What about you?  Did you find that all of your favorite things were always Steamy, and you just had to be told the name of your life-long obsession?  Were you there well before us all, reading Verne and dreaming in steam?  Let me know in a comment.  I&#8217;d love to know.</p>
<p>In the meantime, why not enjoy a little well-deserved hipstery indignation?   Tug your woolly scarf tighter in the summer breeze, slip on a pair of chunky retro lens-less specks, and repeat after me with self-important pride: &#8220;I liked Steampunk before it was cool&#8230;&#8221;  Doesn&#8217;t the just feel delightful?  I love it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sure, we all talk about the great Victorian novels, but how often do we Steampunks really sit down and read them?  We&#8217;re all so busy sewing, writing, reading modern Steampunk, larping and making, who&#8217;s got the time to read the classics?  Well, I do.  If you manage to carve out a few hours for a proper novel and a cup of tea, then check over this list to see if you missed any essentials.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="http://worldsoccertalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/old-books.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="228" /></p>
<h4>1, Around the World in 80 Days,  Jules Verne.</h4>
<p>That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m on Team Verne.  Sorry Wells, but Verne is just more fun.  When I first realized that Steampunk was a genre, this was the first book I ever read specifically looking for Steampunk inspiration.  I gobbled it up in one breath and was inspired enough to start writing my own Steampunk adventures.  This book has it all: fantastic and unique characters, exotic destinations, Victorian social commentary, and enough humor, adventure, and excitement to delight anyone.  And for those of you who think, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve seen the movie.  I don&#8217;t need to read it,&#8221; I will tell you that you&#8217;re utterly wrong!  First of all, there&#8217;s no balloon in the book.  Second, I have never seen a decent portrayal of Passepartout in any film or show.  And lastly, although one actor has played Phileas with dignity, none have ever truly captured the damn sexy subtlety of his true nature.  If you adore gentlemanly adventure like any good Steampunk, and you haven&#8217;t read this book, then you are doing yourself a great disservice.</p>
<h4>2. The Time Machine, H.G. Wells</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t take my siding with Verne as an insult to Wells.  Even though a great deal of his novels were bridging past the Victorian era, The Time Machine is as much a part of Steampunk lore as goggles and airships.  This book has the Dystopian edge that permeates modern Steampunk, and more metaphorical social commentary than you can shake a stick at.  While I personally prefer more layered characters, I can say nothing at all against Wells&#8217;s skill in storytelling.  I would say that the movie (the original, not that weird thing from the 90s) did a better job of portraying the story in the way that it was written, and any movies based on Verne.  Even so, this great work deserves to be read.</p>
<h4>3. The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde.</h4>
<p>Ah, Wilde&#8230;  I&#8217;ve had a literary crush on the work of Oscar Wilde since I was in my teens.  It usually takes me twice as long as normal to finish one of his stories, simply because I keep having to gasp, pause, and re-read every gorgeous line I find &#8230; which is usually about every-other one.  But wait! you say.  Wilde didn&#8217;t write about submarines or airship travel, or time machines!  No, he didn&#8217;t.  He wrote of men&#8217;s true nature and the murky, shadowed depths of the human soul.  In this glorious novel, Wilde explored the dangers of the ego-centered detachment, which the wealthy and the beautiful London aristocrats danced so blindly about.  Here in 2014, it can be difficult to get a clear perspective of what life was really like back there.  If you want to know the motivations of a Londoner of the time, feel the eerie quiet of an empty life in a grand old house, and taste the terror of one&#8217;s own limitless potential in a world of too much freedom, than you will find no better prorate.</p>
<h4>4. A Study in Scarlet, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</h4>
<p>More than just taking us through wonderfully entertaining stories about murder and mystery, Watson provides another great snapshot of what life was like under the rule of Victoria.  From mentioning popular culture (like novels that were once wildly popular but are now unheard of, and which plays, operas, and even fashions were popular at the time) to noting that the sky over London is rather brown today, Watson weaves a tapestry of the time.  The way that the two characters relate to their world in the original stories, tells more than you will ever find on Wiki, or in any of the TV shows and movies that have been made from it.  Not that there is anything wrong with SherlockBBC.  I was simply staggered by the bulk of raw insight that I found in all of the Holmes stories.</p>
<h4>5. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Jules Verne</h4>
<p>I mean really.  How could this book NOT be on any steampunk list?  Sure, there&#8217;s more fish genus than are at all needed.  Sure, Nemo&#8217;s past is never truly explored.  Sure, Ned can be a bit annoying.  But honestly, what would our beloved genre be with this massively inventive, thrillingly adventurous, and truly beautiful work?  All I can say is that, as with most of Verne&#8217;s works, you must be very careful when selecting a translation to read.  The first time I tried to read this book, I couldn&#8217;t get more than a few pages in before I got bored.  But, I found out later that I had been reading a highly abridged version, with truly awful re-writing.  I tried a much more modern translation by <span style="color:#222222;">Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, and suddenly I couldn&#8217;t put the book down!  I tell you right now, if you ever tried to read this book and didn&#8217;t like it, it was entirely because of the translation.  Get a better copy and try it again today!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;</p>
<p>Well, that my top 5 classic Victorian essentials list.  What&#8217;s yours?  Do you agree with my line up?  Did I missing something dreadfully important to the genre?  Leave a comment and let me know your thoughts.  And happy reading!</p>

<p>First of all, I&#8217;m terribly sorry that this blog has been silent for the last few weeks!  See?  Look how sad the clock is&#8230;  My nasty, broken, no-auto-posting blog is just as sad.  We had a talk.  Thing should be running smoothly again, with a weekly blog and an extra picture or two, as of now!  And if it doesn&#8217;t run smoothly, we&#8217;ll have another talk.  That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m looking at you, blog!</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 1!</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve quit my day job!  Pop those party popper, break out the music, and hand me a drink!  After trying to juggle a full-time job and a 12 part series, I finally dropped all the balls at my feet and thought &#8220;Gee, this is silly.&#8221;  I simply had to let something go.  So, bye bye full-time job!  I&#8217;m now only working part-time (more on that later) to help pay the bills, and spending most of my time writing and editing my books.  And honestly, as much as I liked my old job and my co-workers there, I finally feel like Twist and I are really getting somewhere!  Expect great things&#8230;</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 2!</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled upon something quite interesting on Twitter, on Wednesday.  The nerdy powerhouse, <a href="http://geekandsundry.com/" target="_blank">Geek &amp; Sundry</a> started a Twitter tag chat thing (still learning my terms&#8230;) <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23ComicChat&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">#ComicChat</a> with writer <a href="http://www.jimzub.com/bio/" target="_blank">Jim Zub</a>, about a fun looking comic called Figment, that will be released this summer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://geekandsundry.com/view/first-look-disney-kingdoms-newest-comic" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.geekandsundry.com/assets/images/episodes/disney-figment-header.jpg" width="640" height="390" /></a></p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that image just inspire curiosity?  The story of this 5-part comic will center around two characters from a Disney Epcot ride, Journey Into Imagination, called Figment and Dreamfinder.  I&#8217;ve never been to the park myself, but these two look wonderfully interesting.</p>
<p>According to the Disney Wikia: &#8220;Dreamfinder was a character created by Walt Disney Imagineering. He created Figment, a tiny royal purple dragon made of two tiny wings, big yellow eyes, horns of a steer, the body of a lizard and a nose of a crocodile, plus a dash of childish delight. He teaches Figment about the wonders of imagination and takes riders along through all of Figment&#8217;s overdone splendors in his machine&#8217;s Idea Bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Jim said on Twitter, this comic &#8220;has an Oz, Little Nemo, fantastical steampunk approach.&#8221;  To which I reply, shut up and take my money!  As little info as there is on this comic, I&#8217;m already stoked and can&#8217;t wait to follow the adventures of Figment, the child-like purple dragon, and Dreamfinder, the &#8220;steampunk stud&#8221; as Jim called him.</p>
<p>Jim was nice enough to answer all sorts of interesting questions with the <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23ComicChat&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">#ComicChat</a> tag.  He&#8217;s a well established writer, with many a comic under his belt.  Check out his site for <a href="http://www.jimzub.com/category/tutorial/" target="_blank">writing tutorials</a>, FAQs about the <a href="http://www.jimzub.com/comic-qa-rates-cons-and-distrubution/" target="_blank">comic industry</a>, and more!  You can even read some of his digital comics on <a href="http://www.comixology.com/Jim-Zub/comics-creator/6195" target="_blank">comixology.com</a>.  He recommends <a href="http://www.comixology.com/Skullkickers/comics-series/4764" target="_blank">Skullkickers</a>.</p>
<p>As for the artist, Filipe Andrade has worked with Marvel on loads of different comics.  You can find more information on him on his blog.  And here&#8217;s one of my favorite images from one of his other projects.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://filipeandradeart.blogspot.pt/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/0c02ed983f309e9d572df2414b38fb61/tumblr_n0cko4zzJw1qzrurbo1_500.jpg" width="500" height="707" /></a></p>
<p>All in all, this comic looks nothing but good.  Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/JimZub" target="_blank">@JimZub</a> on Twitter, or keep an eye on this blog for updates.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be doing a review as soon as I get my own copy.</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>Are you an author who loves Steampunk as much as I do?   Or, are you just a big big fan of a Steampunk/Neo-Victorian author?  Would you like to see  your favorite book, or your own book, featured on this blog?  Please leave a comment on this post with a short pitch and a link!   I’ll happily feature anything that I think will fit the style of my blog.  And even if I don’t feature it, please please leave your info in a comment anyway!  Who doesn’t love new books?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, my Dad casually mentioned that he found a fun looking Chinese movie on <a href="http://www.netflix.com" target="_blank">Netflix</a>.  My Dad has a tendency to try out movies on a whim, sometimes finding Asylum movies or things that he turns off after 10 minutes, and sometimes finding gold.  If the movie is no good, we can always just switch over to the Catherine Tate Show or re-watch an old Black Books episode to enjoy the rest of our evening.</p>
<p>On this occasion, as with so many others, we settled in for a cozy evening of movie and snacks, innocently unaware of what we were about to watch.  The movie started in the middle of an epic war between a huge army and a single man with a magical horn.  That got my attention.  Then the guy with the top hat, the phonograph, and the giant steam-powered tank  showed up, and I turned to my Dad in shock. &#8220;This is steampunk kung-fu?  That&#8217;s a thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaxrbL96v68]</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s a story about a young man who wants to learn the most powerful fighting style in the land, with a backdrop of beautiful,  late 1800s, rural China.  And it&#8217;s steampunk.  It&#8217;s a delicious combo that I suddenly realized I hadn&#8217;t seen before.  So much of steampunk is either set in London or desolate and dusty patches of America, that I found it a real treat to see all my favorite steamy fun a different setting, and in a different culture.</p>
<p>The whole thing is delightfully goofy.  The characters were charming, the action is great and often comedic, the settings were lovely, and the true villains were excess and the future itself.  If you like kung-fu movies, you&#8217;ll like this one.  If you&#8217;re a steampunk, you&#8217;ll like this movie.  If you like to see the little guy fight for traditions and truth in the face of a greedy and corrupt future, you will like this movie.  If you like cute and bantering rom-coms, you&#8217;ll like this movie.  Even if you just like goofiness for the sake of goofiness, you won&#8217;t be disappointed.  There really is something for everyone!  And for me, it was a lovely surprise as well.</p>
<p>Most critics gave this movie a 6, but I like off-beat things.  If I were a movie reviewer type, I&#8217;d give this fun little find at least an 8.5 out of 10.  Sure, it&#8217;s not Serenity level movie watching perfection, but it&#8217;s fun, silly, and entertaining throughout.  So, if you&#8217;re looking for something fun to watch tonight, go stream <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981080/" target="_blank">Tai Chi Zero</a> on Netflix.  There&#8217;s even a sequel!  I haven&#8217;t seen it myself yet, but the story continues with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2296404/?ref_=tt_rec_tt" target="_blank">Tai Chi Hero</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s you&#8217;re favorite Steampunk movie?  Leave a comment and let me know!  But if you say The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, then I will all throw things at you and call you names.</p>
