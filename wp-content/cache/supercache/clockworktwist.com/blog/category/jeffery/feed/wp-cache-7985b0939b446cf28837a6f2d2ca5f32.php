										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope that you haven&#8217;t noticed yet, but this site is now being hosted by a different company.  How exciting!  There wasn&#8217;t anything wrong with my old hosting service, and I hope there are no hard feelings, but I seem to have a great deal more control on this new service.  Still, I&#8217;ve never moved a site before, and I&#8217;m not sure that everything is exactly as it should be&#8230;</p>
<p>So, if you happen to notice anything odd or amiss at all, or (heaven forbid) hit a 404 or some such horror, please do let me know in the comments down below.  (checks to make sure the comments are still available.)  I&#8217;ll get to fixing any last minute issues as quickly as I can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have I mentioned that I can be a bit long-winded sometimes?  Well, as if I didn&#8217;t know that 12 adventure novels in the same series wasn&#8217;t enough, I&#8217;ve begun working on a new series, in the same universe as the Twist books.  And, it will premier next month!</p>
<p>Do you ever wonder what it would have been like to read the original Sherlock stories in The Strand?  You&#8217;d only get one case, and then have to wait a week for the next one.  There were no compilations of all of them, at first.  Well, I would have loved it.  I personally really enjoy having something live, be it TV, web shows, or the first singles of an upcoming album. to look forward to.  It makes me feel like I&#8217;m a part of something, when I&#8217;m there right at the beginning.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve decided to do just that, with a side-story of my books.  I&#8217;ll be posting new chapters (about 1200 words each) weekly on a new blog that is just for this project, telling a single story at a time.  The first story only came out to 12 chapters, so it&#8217;s not a huge commitment.  And if you miss one, the posts will not be going anywhere.  Also, I will be publishing a permanently free eBook, and a cheap as possible paperback, once all of the chapters are posted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-2330 size-medium" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/front-cover-test.jpg?w=196" alt="Preliminary cover design" width="196" height="300" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/front-cover-test.jpg 1720w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/front-cover-test-196x300.jpg 196w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/front-cover-test-672x1024.jpg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px" />And now, you ask, what will this serial be about?  If you haven&#8217;t read the <a href="/book-two-trick/" target="_blank">second Twist book, Trick</a>, then what I&#8217;m about to tell you really isn&#8217;t a spoiler.  If you have read Trick already, then you&#8217;ll remember Jeffery Simian, the gentlemanly baboon that Myra wished Idris to make out of a coffee pot.  As soon as I saw Jeffery, and saw the way that he and Idris got along, I realized that I had to send the two of them out solving mysteries.  And that, is exactly what I&#8217;ve written.</p>
<p>Jeffery is a baboon in a tweed suit, who has a sense of honor and good diction.  Idris is a powerful djinn who is easily bored and needs constant entertainment.  Together, there can&#8217;t be a single dull day.  The Journals of Jeffery Simian will follow Jeffery and Idris as they explore the world, try to find the most interesting ways for Idris to use his powerful magic, and solve mysteries while they&#8217;re at it.  This will be a very fun side adventure, and will be more in a gaslamp fantasy style than straight steampunk.  And best of all, it&#8217;s free!</p>
<p>Why is it all free?  Because I have met with nothing but love and support from all of my readers.  You guys are the best!  I wanted to give you something special, just for being awesome.  I also wanted to create something else that could lure people who haven&#8217;t ready my books in, to take a look at Twist.  And really, who says no to free?</p>
<p>I hope to continue writing these little stories of Jeffery and Idris, and releasing them between Twist novel releases.  If all goes well, I would be able to publish 4 books a year, without compromising quality.  Honestly, it only took me about 2 weeks to write this little side story, and I&#8217;m currently writing Clockwork Twist: Book Seven.  See?  Told you I was long-winded.</p>
<p>Anyway, keep an eye on <a href="clockworktwist.com" target="_blank">my blog</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/CWTwist" target="_blank">twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/CWTwist" target="_blank">facebook</a>, <a href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">tumblr</a>, or whatever, to see when the first chapter of the The Journals of Jeffery Simian will appear.  This will be such a fun little ride!</p>
