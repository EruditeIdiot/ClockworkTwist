<p>Before I can really talk about my experience of writing a series, I feel I should give a bit more background about my writing history.  The first book I ever wrote was a sci-fi world-jumping novel, and it took me about a year to get the first draft on paper.  I started it in 1997 and I think I finished it in 1998, when I was a wee little 15 year-old.  Naturally, it was over 100,000 words and horrendous.  #noobwriter  But I re-wrote it about 14 times over the next 8 years (yes, I said 8), until it improved into a solidly mediocre and derivative piece.  Feeling pleased with my moderate success, I moved on to writing the sequel to this first book and was already thinking about it as a trilogy.  As of today, no one outside of my family and mentors have ever seen any of it, and now that I know what I&#8217;m doing no one ever will until it gets a massive overhaul.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s just re-count what my very first writing experience actually was.  I didn&#8217;t start with a short-story.  I didn&#8217;t even start with fan-fiction.  I started with a beef-stake sci-fi novel that turned into part 1 of a trilogy before I finished the first draft.  More than that, I was re-working the same story and the same basic plot for years, without really taking a break.  Sure, I was in school and had lots of things going on, but I was working seriously on that book/trilogy for about 8 years solid, and was trying to get it published, right up until I got another idea.</p>
<p>The second book I finished was inspired by my visits to Tokyo.  I went there a few times for vacation with a friend, then studied abroad in Tokyo a few years after that.  The book I wrote about Japan wasn&#8217;t sci-fi or fantasy at all, but was just general fiction, about riding the trains in Tokyo.  This time, I had a pretty good idea of how to put a book together before I started it, and I got it into a decent shape and polished enough to start shopping it around to my publishing contacts in less than two years, by 2007.  But since that was so much easier than stumbling about with my first trilogy, I immediately thought I might make the Japan book into a series, and also use it as an excuse to travel.  I could write the same kind of story in any city with trains, after all.  How about Paris, or New York, or Hong Kong?  Splendid!</p>
<p>Then, life hit me square in the nose.  For the first time in 10 years, I stopped writing because I just didn&#8217;t have the time.  I still tried from time to time to work up something fun or go back and add more to my old series, just for fun, but I had not series.  Things eventually calmed down in my life and I finally managed to write an actual short story in 2010.  It was about a man who was a projectionist at an old movie theater, and was obsessed with old movies from the 30s and 40s, rejecting modern life for the silver elegance of the past.  I still think it&#8217;s pretty good.  And I can&#8217;t tell you how thrilling it was to be writing again!  As soon as I finished the story, however, and saw that it came to a neat and elegant end, I felt an enormous sense of loss.  The story was over.  What a horrible thought.  I instantly rejected the idea and tried to stretch it into a book at least, but it just wasn&#8217;t there.  I had to let it go.</p>
<p>Desperate now to get back under that cozy, heavy, warm duvet of writing a series after years out in the cold, I picked up Steampunk.  I&#8217;d recently realized that all my favorite books and movies fit until that genre title, and was enamored with the whole idea.  But I&#8217;d never tried to write in it.  So, after my recent success, I started with a short story.  Before I got ten pages in, it became a book.  But, since I wasn&#8217;t used to Steampunk, it wasn&#8217;t working as well as I&#8217;d liked.  I kept swinging wide over historical fiction, then coming back over pure fantasy, without ever getting the feel for it.  Plus, as much as I liked the characters, they weren&#8217;t as good as the projectionist and his friends.  Frustrated, I decided to start over with a new idea entirely, just as soon as I came up with something.</p>
<p>Then, after seeing a fantastic live play that was a Steampunk version of <em>Twelfth Night</em>, something finally clicked in my head and I got a grip on Steampunk.  I went home after the play and wrote the first chapter of Waking.  The moment I saw Twist, I knew something was different.  He was special.  And by the time I was 5 pages in, I knew he needed room to run.  I decided, right there on the 5th page, to go for the series.  In three months (my personal best at the time) the first book was done and I&#8217;d started on the second.  With re-writes and edits of previous Twist books to pad out my time, I wrote another two 80,000 page novels in the next year, and two more the year after that.  Last year I wrote three.</p>
<p>So, in the last 17 years I&#8217;ve spent 3 not working on a series of some kind.  The only time I ever stopped a story and didn&#8217;t just shelve it for later continuation, it was traumatic.  I still miss Steve the projectionist sometimes.  I can&#8217;t imagine what I&#8217;m going to do at the end of Twist 12.  And no, I won&#8217;t just keep going because I watched Lost and I&#8217;m not going to do that to you.  There will be an ending, because Twist needs one to be whole.  But over the years, I&#8217;ve begun to realize that series writing is very much a comfy mental duvet for me.  Stuck in an elevator?  It&#8217;s cool, I&#8217;ll just work on pruning my mythology for a minute.  Can&#8217;t sleep?  Well, how <em>am</em> I going to get Twist to do that thing he really doesn&#8217;t want to do in that next scene?  Red Light?  No problem, I&#8217;ve got delicate social interactions between deeply damaged people to sort out.  It&#8217;s always there, and it&#8217;s soft and comfortable, and as familiar as pumpkin spice.</p>
<p>So, besides some rather obvious emotional issues I might want to stop ignoring, what does all this mean?  Is it possible that some writers just can&#8217;t do short while others just can&#8217;t do long?  Is it really that different at all?  I don&#8217;t know, but I hope to find out.  I&#8217;ll continue this idea in a later post.  In the meantime, please share your thoughts on writing in a comment.  Whether you&#8217;re an accomplished author, or just dabble in writing, I&#8217;d love to hear what your experience has been like.  Or have you noticed anything like this in your reading habits?  Let me know.  And thanks for reading so far.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/024350e2f7bccc3f920ee521be136160/tumblr_nc98uhTub01rpuw07o1_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="337" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image taken from thegoodvybe&#8217;s Tumblr feed</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m lazy.  I&#8217;m much rather spend time writing, reading, watching Supernatural all over again on Netflix, or assassinating people in Renaissance Italy (hello, PS3 game reference!) than do anything that feels like work.  And unless I need Tumblr therapy after a particularly heart-wrenching season finally, or I&#8217;m glued to Twitter praying in vain for a YES vote for Scotland&#8217;s indyref debate, social media always feel like work to me.  I know that many people count Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and all the others as fun-time, I just don&#8217;t.  I use them too, but I get board really easy.  However, as an indie author, it&#8217;s professional suicide to not build a following everywhere I can to help promote my books.</p>
<p>So, whether you&#8217;re like me and can&#8217;t be bothered to spend hours trying to gain followers on 10 different sites, or you just don&#8217;t have the time or know-how required, here are two tricks that I&#8217;ve used to save my sanity.</p>
<h4>First, the power of the Tumblr Queue:  <a href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://www.shannonassociates.com/home_boxes/tumblr-logo-vector_11212_1110912.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="90" /></a></h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re over 25, there&#8217;s only a slight chance that you have a Tumblr account or use it often.  But let me tell you, the fan-girls/boys of Tumblr are a mighty force.  More than that, Tumblr can be bent to the will of the time-challenges with just a few easy steps.  First of all, when you create a new post or re-blog, there are always 5 option to chose from, under the little arrow on the right of he blue button: 1 Post Now, 2 Add to queue, 3 Schedule, 4 Save as draft, and 5 Post privately.  Using the 1st option, your post will appear immediately.  But the true power of Tumblr comes from the 2nd and 3rd options.</p>
<p>If you decide to Queue your post, it will sit in a holding area, waiting to be automatically posted.  Once you queue something, you can then click on &#8220;Queue&#8221; on the right side of your Tumblr dashboard, and find setting on how often your account will auto-post your queued posts.  You can choose a range of time each day, and how many posts will appear each day.  Then, they will appear on their own, without you having to do another living thing.  The only thing to watch out for is the hashtags, which annoying re-set when you re-blog.  Just be sure to add them back in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that by spending 1 hard-core searching and re-blogging session, I amassed over 100 posts in my queue.  Now, I could have immediately re-blogged everything, but then my Tumblr feed would have been a huge spam-fest, and then silent.  Instead, the topical posts I found will appear in reasonable fashion, making it look as if my feed might be nice to follow&#8230;</p>
<h4>Second, the might and magic of IFTTT: <a href="http://ifttt.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://phandroid.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ifttt-logo-large.png" alt="" width="232" height="86" /></a></h4>
<p>So ok, now your Tumblr is running like a top, and people are starting to follow you there.  But you haven&#8217;t touched your Twitter for months and your Facebook is boring as heck.  Never fear, IFTTT is here!  IFTTT = If This Then That.</p>
<p>This magical site is one of the most powerful tools I&#8217;ve ever seen on-line.  Using this tool, you can silently link all sorts of things that don&#8217;t normally go together.  Wish your phone would alert you when there&#8217;s a rain warning in your area?  Want to get a text message every time the ISS flies overhead?  Want to make it so that all of your blogs post the same thing simultaneously without you having to lift a finger?  IFTTT can do that!  Just get yourself a free account, hook up all your accounts, and presto!  You&#8217;re suddenly a social media ninja.</p>
<p>My favorite tools to use are A) 500px-to-Tumblr-Drafts, B) WeHeartIt-hearted-images-to-Tumblr-drafts, C) Tumblr-image-post-to-Twitter-native-image-post, and D) Tumblr-to-Facebook.  A auto searches the site 500px for images tagged with my terms, and then dump them into my Tumblr Drafts folder so that I can curate them and add the ones I like to mt queue.  B automatically adds every image I heart on WeHeartIt to my Tumblr Drafts folder too.  Using these two tools, my queue grew from 100 to 300 in a week.</p>
<p>C fixes that nasty annoying thing that Twitter does when you share an image from another site.  If I just clicked the share button from Tumblr, my Twitter would only post a link, and not a full image.  Since this is a problem, anyone who does post full pictures gets a lot more attention on Twitter, so it&#8217;s nice to have them show up.  With this tool, I don&#8217;t even have to click share.  Any image that is posted on my Tumblr feed is automatically posted as a full image on my Twitter.  Now, my Twitter looks awesome, and I still hardly actually go there to use it.  D does the same thing as C, but with Facebook, so that my Facebook page feed gets love too, even when I hardly go there either.</p>
<h4>The up-shot:</h4>
<p>And why, you might ask, would it be worth all this set up to just get some pretty pictures up on my sites all the time?  Because, my books are steampunk, and steampunk fans are visual people.  If I want their attention, I&#8217;d better have lots of shiny pocket watches, battling airships, and the like to offer.  If your fans are more literary, then re-blog quotes and articles.  If your fans are romance junkies, then there&#8217;s plenty of provocative imagery and info on other romance books to share.  The point is, that once your feeds have nice things, and people searching for related tags find you, and start sharing you, their friends will follow you too, and their friends, and your fan base will only get bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you rather have hundreds and thousands of people already paying attention to your Twitter, Facebook, and even your Tumblr when you have something important to announce about the project you&#8217;re selling?  Doing this is the easiest way I&#8217;ve ever found to do just that, without having to spend time doing it all by hand.  My followers has already grown by 30% in the last few weeks alone.  My Tumblr queue is sitting pretty at over 300 posts ready to post, 3 a day, across three sites, for over 3 months solid.  In the coming months, I expect my followers to only grow faster and faster.</p>
<p>So, if you think that this sort of trick would improve your internet life, then give it a shot!  Share this post to anyone else you know who is in need of a quick fan-base, or just wants to build on what they already have.  And if you try it, please let me know how it works for you!  All I know is how it works for me, which is simply splendid.</p>
<p>And of course, follow me on the social media site of your choice.  <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-facebook" title="Follow Twist on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/CWTwist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="facebook"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Follow Twist on Facebook" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/facebook.png" alt="facebook" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-twitter" title="Follow Twist on Twitter" href="http://twiter.com/CWTwist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="twitter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Follow Twist on Twitter" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/twitter.png" alt="twitter" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-rss" title="Subscribe to Twist's RSS Feed" href="http://clockworktwist.com/feed/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="rss"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Subscribe to Twist's RSS Feed" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/rss.png" alt="rss" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-normal synved-social-provider-tumblr" title="Follow Twist on Tumblr" href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-provider="tumblr"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow" title="Follow Twist on Tumblr" src="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/24x24/tumblr.png" alt="tumblr" width="24" height="24" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello internet.  Usually on this blog, I share cool things that I find in the course of my steampunk existence or learn as a writer.  But since it&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day today, I thought I&#8217;d just tell you how Twist is doing.  I tend to call him &#8220;my baby&#8221; more often that he&#8217;d probably appreciate, and I love him so that I sometimes feel like a mother myself.  Don&#8217;t worry.  There&#8217;ll be more silly steamy things next week.</p>
<p>Since publishing <a title="Book one : Waking" href="/waking/" target="_blank">Waking</a> last year, and <a title="Book two : Trick" href="/book-two-trick/" target="_blank">Trick</a> last January, I&#8217;ve been working extra hard on finishing the first drafts of the rest of this 12 part series.  I&#8217;m getting ready to publish the 3rd book in the series later this year, and realizing that I&#8217;d like to be sure of exactly where the series is headed before I publish too much more.</p>
<p>Of course, I already know how I want the story to close at the end of the 12th novel, and I have copious notes on what will happen in the meantime, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;ve gotten there yet.  At the moment, while I write this post, I have completed writing (not editing) the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th books, along with 27 pages of the 7th.  So why, you ask, aren&#8217;t more of them out yet?  Because things in these books like to change over time.</p>
<p>As I write this series, I find that little details turn out to mean unexpected things as future events unfold on the page.  The events might occur just as I&#8217;d meant them to from the beginning, but sometimes the implications change.  And sometimes, I suddenly realize that I was completely wrong about a plot line and have to go in a totally different direction, while still following the same basic story line.  Some scenes that I mean to write turn out to be useless when I get to writing them, while other unexpected moments appear and surprise me by how perfectly they fit.  And sometimes (more often than I like to think) I realize that the book I just finished writing is actually a better fit for the fourth or fifth book in line, rather than the third, and I now have to write a whole other book or two between it and the last one.</p>
<p>With all of this flux, I hate to publish too close to where I&#8217;m writing.  When <a title="Book one : Waking" href="/waking/" target="_blank">Waking</a> first came out, I had already finished the 4th book and was half way through the 5th.  When <a title="Book two : Trick" href="/book-two-trick/" target="_blank">Trick</a> was published, I had added a different book in the 5th place, and then re-wrote the old 5th book to make it the 6th.  As long as I have about 4 books between where I&#8217;m writing and where I publish, I can feel confident that I won&#8217;t ever have to adjust anything in the published work to make the ending work.   It&#8217;s my goal, after all, is to share this story with you, in a smooth, complete, and solid form.</p>
<p>Are you writing a series as well?  Have you ever encountered these sorts of things?  Please leave me a comment down below if you have.  I&#8217;d love to know what you think about all of this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m working very hard to finish the series as quickly as possible, so that I can make sure it will be the best work it can be.  In the scene I just wrote a few days ago, Jonas casually mentioned that he, Twist, and Myra had already traveled to every continent on the globe, and ventured into orbit as well.  I so wish I could tell you all about what is happening right now in the 7th book, but I must hold my tongue!  But I can promise that there are wonderful things in store for you as you follow Twist into the future books.</p>
<p>I hope you have a lovely Mother&#8217;s Day, however you choose to spend it!</p>
