<p>First of all, I&#8217;m terribly sorry that this blog has been silent for the last few weeks!  See?  Look how sad the clock is&#8230;  My nasty, broken, no-auto-posting blog is just as sad.  We had a talk.  Thing should be running smoothly again, with a weekly blog and an extra picture or two, as of now!  And if it doesn&#8217;t run smoothly, we&#8217;ll have another talk.  That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m looking at you, blog!</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 1!</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve quit my day job!  Pop those party popper, break out the music, and hand me a drink!  After trying to juggle a full-time job and a 12 part series, I finally dropped all the balls at my feet and thought &#8220;Gee, this is silly.&#8221;  I simply had to let something go.  So, bye bye full-time job!  I&#8217;m now only working part-time (more on that later) to help pay the bills, and spending most of my time writing and editing my books.  And honestly, as much as I liked my old job and my co-workers there, I finally feel like Twist and I are really getting somewhere!  Expect great things&#8230;</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 2!</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/157210707/stained-kinetic-nautilus-gear-pendant?ref=shop_home_active_3" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="http://img1.etsystatic.com/024/0/7231497/il_570xN.481517455_3trs.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="192" /></a>I got a part-time job with <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/SteamyTech" target="_blank">SteamyTech</a>!  You know them, right?  Every good steampunk knows them.  They&#8217;re the people who make the wooden geared things that actually work.  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/SteamyTech" target="_blank">Go check out their Esty</a>.  SteamyTech is expanding and trying to get their lovely little toys and wooden bow-ties farther out into the world.  And that means that they need to cut loads of wooden bits on their fancy laser cutter&#8230;  That&#8217;s right, I now get to play with lasers.  I win!</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 3!</h4>
<p><a href="http://steampunkchronicle.com/SPCAwards/Voting/tabid/513/Default.aspx" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://steampunkchronicle.com/portals/4/SPCArticles/2014/Bestof/SPC_RCA_logo_2014_400.png" alt="" width="184" height="161" /></a>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, Clockwork Twist: Waking has been nominated for Best Fiction by the <a href="http://steampunkchronicle.com/" target="_blank">Steampunk Chronicle</a>!  I can hardly believe it, and I&#8217;m so honored.  Go check out what else has been <a href="http://steampunkchronicle.com/SPCAwards/Voting/tabid/513/Default.aspx" target="_blank">nominated for the best of steampunk</a>!  &#8230;and maybe, you know, scroll down to the literature section and &#8230; you know&#8230; (coy smile)  *Whispers* &#8220;It&#8217;s the &#8216;best fiction&#8217; one.  Clockwork Twist&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>My mother, the awesome poet<a href="http://janice-t.weebly.com" target="_blank"> JaniceT</a> has also been nominated for her book, Echoes: Neo-Victorian Poetry.  I&#8217;m ever so proud.  Voting will close on the 12th.  Just, you know, in case you wanted to know that&#8230; *wink, wink*</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 4!</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.inkshares.com/projects/clockwork-twist-dreamer" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="http://www.inkshares.com/assets/icons/inkshares_logo3_transparent-c6edf8081c45b265511a6baa98da1a8f.png" alt="" width="126" height="126" /></a>There&#8217;s still time to support Clockwork Twist and get sneak previews (and a free copy) of the 3rd book, Clockwork Twist: Dreamer, which will be out later this year!   Inkshares is a new crowdfunded publishing house, that is very excited to help propel the Clockwork Twist series into the world on a much wider distribution than it&#8217;s ever had before!<br />

<p>Wow!  That was a lot that my stupid blog didn&#8217;t post about.  Well, now you should be all caught up.  And if I missed anything, I&#8217;ll let you know about it all as soon as I remember!  I&#8217;m sorry about for the technical issues.  I hope you&#8217;ve all had a lovely few weeks as well!</p>

<p>While puppetry appears as an art form in many cultures, I have to say that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang#Wayang_golek" target="_blank">wayang galek</a> (Indonesian style wooden doll puppets) are my favorite style.</p>
<p><a href="http://galeriwayanggolek.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-579" alt="ed002" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ed002.jpg?w=186" width="186" height="300" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ed002-186x300.jpg 186w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ed002-638x1024.jpg 638w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></p>
<p>Just look at these beautiful examples!  These gorgeous puppets have such grace and whimsy to them, that I honestly got the idea for a dancing clockwork puppet directly from them.  Naturally, the idea changed a great deal as I got into the story, and I&#8217;ve never found a wayang galek made of clockwork.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of &#8220;wayang&#8221; puppets.  There is a silhouette style made of metal, called wayang kulit, which have a much more Hinduistic look to them, leading some to believe that this art form came to Indonesia from India or China.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-580" alt="wayang_golek_p61" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wayang_golek_p61.jpg?w=202" width="202" height="300" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wayang_golek_p61.jpg 685w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wayang_golek_p61-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" />All I know for sure is that I these puppets are truly captivating.  I imagine Myra would have loved to watch them as a child.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-513 alignright" alt="himitsu" src="http://192.185.17.126/~cwtwist/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/himitsu.jpg" width="233" height="156" srcset="http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/himitsu.jpg 367w, http://clockworktwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/himitsu-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /></p>
<p>Apparently, I&#8217;m one of a scant few who sees more than just time in the face of a clock.  Let me ask you one little question, to see if you&#8217;re also an eurodite chronophile.</p>
<p>On a roman-numeral numbered clock face, how SHOULD the number &#8216;4&#8217; be written?</p>
<p>If you know your timepiece lore, this question would be either easy or controversial.  If you know your roman-numerals but not your clocks, you just answered wrong.  If you know neither, then sit back and learn, you lovely, young and innocent thing, you!</p>
<p><span id="more-511"></span>Now, as we know, roman-numerals run in a systematic sequence.</p>
<p>I = 1, II = 2, III = 3, IV = 4, V =5, VI = 6, and so forth, continuing on into constructions like XLII for 42 and the utterly ridiculous  MDCCCLXXVIII for 1878.</p>
<p>Knowing this, one would reason that the &#8220;4&#8221; on a clock should be &#8220;IV&#8221; as it would be for anything else.  However, humanity is far too goofy for that.  I&#8217;ve seen both &#8220;IV&#8221; and &#8220;IIII&#8221; on clocks from all different eras.  When I started to build the cover and promotional images for Twist, I realized that I had to find a rule to follow.</p>
<p>There are actually many, many stories and supposed reasons for why the &#8216;4&#8217;s would be written differently.  One story says that Louis XIV (14th, in case you have a headache) insisted it should be written &#8216;IIII&#8217; and, being the king, was not to be corrected.  Which is ironic, given the way we write his name.  I&#8217;ve also read that some clock makers simply like the look, one way or another, for reasons of symmetry.  Yet another theory says that it&#8217;s just plain easier to make simple iron bars than &#8220;V&#8221;s for the faces of large tower clocks.</p>
<p>By far my favorite theory hankers back to the very dawn of time keeping.  It seems that the Romans were the first to write out &#8220;IIII&#8221; on sundials.  Maybe it was because &#8220;IV&#8221; was Jupiter&#8217;s nickname.  Maybe it was because they liked the symmetry too.  Maybe they just couldn&#8217;t be bothered to be consistent.  Either way, once people started to make clocks instead of sundials, they left a little homage to those first great chronologists. on purpose.</p>
<p>And so, I decided to join the ranks of the &#8220;IIII&#8221;ers.  But is it really right or wrong to use either one?  It certainly isn&#8217;t a mistake, either way.  It&#8217;s just one more reason to gaze pensively into the beautiful faces of old clocks and pocket watches whenever you get the chance&#8230;</p>

<p>When I found Sabang city, with it&#8217;s almost totally lack of British influence during the period of my book (1878), it&#8217;s lush surrounding jungles, and these gorgeous beaches, I realized I&#8217;d found the perfect place.  Not only is it a lovely place, but these islands are also pretty volcanic, making it likely that there are some good caves, hidden deep underground&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Naturally, the bits about the airship towers and the magical clockwork puppet shop (or what&#8217;s hidden in those dark caves) were not entirely based in fact.  Of course, you never know.  I haven&#8217;t been to Sabang yet.  Have you?  If so, please leave me a comment and tell me if it really is as awesome as it looks!</p>

<p>The Tiger&#8217;s nest is considered a &#8220;hanging monastery,&#8221; of which there are several around the world.  Click here for a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2150810/On-wing-prayer-The-extraordinary-hanging-monasteries-cling-sides-cliffs.html" target="_blank">wonderful article </a>on these breathtaking sites.  I purposely placed my palace in Nepal and not Bhutan because I didn&#8217;t want to say that it was actually meant to be the Tiger&#8217;s Nest.  My interpretation of the structure was only loosely based on reality.</p>
<p>But wow&#8230; I could just look at these photos all day.  <a href="http://fineartamerica.com/featured/famous-tigers-nest-monastery-of-bhutan-lanjee-chee.html" target="_blank">Want a nice poster?</a></p>

<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1361570996684_1931" align="LEFT"><span id="yui_3_7_2_1_1361570996684_1930" style="color:#000000;">    <span id="yui_3_7_2_1_1361570996684_1929" style="font-family:'New Times Roman';"><span id="yui_3_7_2_1_1361570996684_1928" style="font-size:large;">My beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without losing or gaining, and without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping. I had come to believe it infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to consider its constitution and its anatomy imperishable. But at last, one night, I let it run down. <span id="more-208"></span>I grieved about it as if it were a recognized messenger and forerunner of calamity. But by and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, and commanded my bodings and superstitions to depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler&#8217;s to set it by the exact time, and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to set it for me. Then he said, &#8220;She is four minutes slow &#8212; regulator wants pushing up.&#8221; I tried to stop him &#8212; tried to make him understand that the watch kept perfect time. But no; all this human cabbage could see was that the watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator MUST be pushed up a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored him to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within the week it sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred and fifty in the shade. At the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac. It was away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were still turning. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such things, in such a ruinous way that I could not abide it. I took it to the watchmaker to be regulated. He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said no, it had never needed any repairing. He looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried the watch open, and then put a small dice box into his eye and peered into its machinery. He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating -come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed down to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left by trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch strung out three days&#8217; grace to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted back into yesterday, then day before, then into last week, and by and by the comprehension came upon me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along in week before last, and the world was out of sight. I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and desire to swap news with him. I went to a watch maker again. He took the watch all to pieces while I waited, and then said the barrel was &#8220;swelled.&#8221; He said he could reduce it in three days. After this the watch AVERAGED well, but nothing more. For half a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking and wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear myself think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there was not a watch in the land that stood any chance against it. But the rest of the day it would keep on slowing down and fooling along until all the clocks it had left behind caught up again. So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would trot up to the judges&#8217; stand all right and just in time. It would show a fair and square average, and no man could say it had done more or less than its duty. But a correct average is only a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to another watchmaker. He said the kingbolt was broken. I said I was glad it was nothing more serious. To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the kingbolt was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger. He repaired the kingbolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost in another. It would run awhile and then stop awhile, and then run awhile again, and so on, using its own discretion about the intervals. And every time it went off it kicked back like a musket. I padded my breast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another watchmaker. He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under his glass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with the hairtrigger. He fixed it, and gave it a fresh start. It did well now, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut together like a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would travel together. The oldest man in the world could not make head or tail of the time of day by such a watch, and so I went again to have the thing repaired. This person said that the crystal had got bent, and that the mainspring was not straight. He also remarked that part of the works needed halfsoling. He made these things all right, and then my timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after working along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let go all of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would straightway begin to spin round and round so fast that their individuality was lost completely, and they simply seemed a delicate spider&#8217;s web over the face of the watch. She would reel off the next twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on while he took her to pieces. Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for this thing was getting serious. The watch had cost two hundred dollars originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for repairs. While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this watchmaker an old acquaintance &#8212; a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a good engineer, either. He examined all the parts carefully, just as the other watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of manner.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="color:#000000;">    <span style="font-family:'New Times Roman';"><span style="font-size:large;">I brained him on the spot, and had him buried at my own expense.</span></span></span></p>

And he used to wonder what became of all the unsuccessful tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoemakers, and engineers, and blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell him.</span></span></span></p>
