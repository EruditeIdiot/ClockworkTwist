<p>Hello, lovelies!  Sorry about stepping out like that.  Right after I put this blog on pause, the chaos in my life intensified exponentially.  Typical, right?  Not to whine, and not to go into too much detail, I had a failed surgery, then a much better one that fixed the problem, lost two dear friends suddenly and in the space of a week, lost my job, got another job and then lost that very quickly.  When I paused the blog, I was only expecting the surgery part, not any of the rest.  Now that things have calmed down somewhat, I&#8217;m starting to get my feet back under me.  My family and I went to the circus just for the hell of it, went to see our favorite comedian preform, and I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy a few times too.  It&#8217;s funny how sometimes even the silliest and more trivial things can trigger true healing, isn&#8217;t it?  And so, here I am.  Still a bit dizzy, but back in the world!  lol</p>
<p>In the meantime, all things Twist have been progressing nicely.  Honestly, Twist was the only thing I wanted to work on through all of my troubles.  It was just a nice, cozy place to be.  Book 3 is in final edits as we speak, and I&#8217;m nearly finished with the cover design!  I&#8217;m so excited to show you all!  I&#8217;ll have a preview of the cover up soon, along with the first 3 chapters, as usual.  Stay tuned!</p>
<p><a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Jeffery</a> is also starting to get some attention as well, which pleases me greatly.  The 11th chapter of his little story will go live on Thursday, and <a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/journal-entries/" target="_blank">all the previous chapters</a> are still available to enjoy.  I&#8217;m going to leave that book on his blog indefinitely, as a forever freebie, just for you.  But I&#8217;ll also be releasing it as an eBook and paperback as well, at the lowest price The Great And Powerful Amazon will allow.</p>
<p>Other than all of that, I discovered something magical!  Have you ever used <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>?  It&#8217;s amazing.  I&#8217;m probably going to do a whole blog post about it soon, and how I&#8217;m using it&#8217;s awesome might to my own ends.  In the meantime, check out my <a href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/cwtwist" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/CWTwist" target="_blank">Facebook</a> for daily visual treats.  And that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll say for now&#8230;</p>
<p>Lastly, I&#8217;d like to mention that I&#8217;m going to be changing things up a little around here.  You might see less pure steampunk things in the future.  Following a single theme was very helpful for me as I learned the art of blogging and social mediaing, but now it&#8217;s becoming restrictive.  There&#8217;s plenty of beauty and great stories in the world, outside of one genre.  I&#8217;ll still be sharing lots of Victorian goodies and as many pretty pocket watches as I can find, but there were be less steamy items as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking around, while I dealt with my issues.  You guys are the best!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello, lovelies.  I can&#8217;t blame my blog on missing a post yesterday, or the lesser content that I&#8217;ve had to offer recently.  Like a sagging dirigible in a gale, I&#8217;m simply getting a bit swamped by my life and things are starting to slip through my rigging.</p>
<p>I want to write interesting, engaging posts, and share wonderful shiny things, and keep a real sense of delight in this blog.  At the moment, however, I find I simply don&#8217;t have the time and energy needed to keep this blog running at the level that I want.</p>
<p>So, for the time being, I&#8217;ve decided to take a short holiday from this blog so that I might recollect myself, get my ducks in a row, and all of that.  Don&#8217;t worry about the progress of the novels.  Writing is still my first priority.  The 3rd novel in the Clockwork Twist series is still set for release in November this year, I&#8217;ve just finished the first draft of the 7th book, and I&#8217;m beginning to work on the 8th now.<br />
<a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/journal-entries/"><img decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://jefferysimian.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/front-cover-test.jpg?w=196&amp;h=300" alt="" width="181" height="276" /></a><br />
To tide you over in the meantime, I encourage you to check out <a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">The Journals of Jeffery Simian</a> over on <a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/journal-entries/" target="_blank">Jeffery&#8217;s blog</a>.  The first serialized novelette is already running, with 5 whole chapters available for your reading pleasure right now, and new chapters each week!  It&#8217;s a fun little romp through the Clockwork Twist universe, from the perspective of our favorite gentlemanly baboon.  Travel to a circus made entirely of ice and battle winter faeries with Jeffery and Idris, his faithful djinn companion.  It&#8217;s good fun.</p>
<p>Over the next little while, I will endeavor to bring this blog back to glory!  Be sure to follow me on <a href="http://twiter.com/CWTwist" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/CWTwist" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, or<a href="http://cwtwist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"> Tumblr</a>, to be notified the moment this thing goes back online.  I wish you a glorious day, and a bright future to come.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope that you haven&#8217;t noticed yet, but this site is now being hosted by a different company.  How exciting!  There wasn&#8217;t anything wrong with my old hosting service, and I hope there are no hard feelings, but I seem to have a great deal more control on this new service.  Still, I&#8217;ve never moved a site before, and I&#8217;m not sure that everything is exactly as it should be&#8230;</p>
<p>So, if you happen to notice anything odd or amiss at all, or (heaven forbid) hit a 404 or some such horror, please do let me know in the comments down below.  (checks to make sure the comments are still available.)  I&#8217;ll get to fixing any last minute issues as quickly as I can.</p>
<p><a href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/2014/07/03/entry-01/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://jefferysimian.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/logo01.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="270" /></a>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s July, the 3rd.  You know what that means, don&#8217;t you?  That&#8217;s right, today is the first day of the Jeffery Simian serial adventures!!  The first post is up as of right now!  <a title="Entry #1" href="http://jefferysimian.wordpress.com/2014/07/03/entry-01/" target="_blank">Click here</a> or click on the monkey head to go check it out.</p>
<p>And of course, keep your eyes peeled for the following entries as they appear, each Thursday at noon, pst, until mid September.</p>
<p>Happy adventuring!</p>

<p>First of all, I&#8217;m terribly sorry that this blog has been silent for the last few weeks!  See?  Look how sad the clock is&#8230;  My nasty, broken, no-auto-posting blog is just as sad.  We had a talk.  Thing should be running smoothly again, with a weekly blog and an extra picture or two, as of now!  And if it doesn&#8217;t run smoothly, we&#8217;ll have another talk.  That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m looking at you, blog!</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 1!</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve quit my day job!  Pop those party popper, break out the music, and hand me a drink!  After trying to juggle a full-time job and a 12 part series, I finally dropped all the balls at my feet and thought &#8220;Gee, this is silly.&#8221;  I simply had to let something go.  So, bye bye full-time job!  I&#8217;m now only working part-time (more on that later) to help pay the bills, and spending most of my time writing and editing my books.  And honestly, as much as I liked my old job and my co-workers there, I finally feel like Twist and I are really getting somewhere!  Expect great things&#8230;</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 2!</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/157210707/stained-kinetic-nautilus-gear-pendant?ref=shop_home_active_3" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="http://img1.etsystatic.com/024/0/7231497/il_570xN.481517455_3trs.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="192" /></a>I got a part-time job with <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/SteamyTech" target="_blank">SteamyTech</a>!  You know them, right?  Every good steampunk knows them.  They&#8217;re the people who make the wooden geared things that actually work.  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/SteamyTech" target="_blank">Go check out their Esty</a>.  SteamyTech is expanding and trying to get their lovely little toys and wooden bow-ties farther out into the world.  And that means that they need to cut loads of wooden bits on their fancy laser cutter&#8230;  That&#8217;s right, I now get to play with lasers.  I win!</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 3!</h4>
<p><a href="http://steampunkchronicle.com/SPCAwards/Voting/tabid/513/Default.aspx" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://steampunkchronicle.com/portals/4/SPCArticles/2014/Bestof/SPC_RCA_logo_2014_400.png" alt="" width="184" height="161" /></a>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, Clockwork Twist: Waking has been nominated for Best Fiction by the <a href="http://steampunkchronicle.com/" target="_blank">Steampunk Chronicle</a>!  I can hardly believe it, and I&#8217;m so honored.  Go check out what else has been <a href="http://steampunkchronicle.com/SPCAwards/Voting/tabid/513/Default.aspx" target="_blank">nominated for the best of steampunk</a>!  &#8230;and maybe, you know, scroll down to the literature section and &#8230; you know&#8230; (coy smile)  *Whispers* &#8220;It&#8217;s the &#8216;best fiction&#8217; one.  Clockwork Twist&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>My mother, the awesome poet<a href="http://janice-t.weebly.com" target="_blank"> JaniceT</a> has also been nominated for her book, Echoes: Neo-Victorian Poetry.  I&#8217;m ever so proud.  Voting will close on the 12th.  Just, you know, in case you wanted to know that&#8230; *wink, wink*</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Announcement 4!</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.inkshares.com/projects/clockwork-twist-dreamer" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="http://www.inkshares.com/assets/icons/inkshares_logo3_transparent-c6edf8081c45b265511a6baa98da1a8f.png" alt="" width="126" height="126" /></a>There&#8217;s still time to support Clockwork Twist and get sneak previews (and a free copy) of the 3rd book, Clockwork Twist: Dreamer, which will be out later this year!   Inkshares is a new crowdfunded publishing house, that is very excited to help propel the Clockwork Twist series into the world on a much wider distribution than it&#8217;s ever had before!<br />
Get in while it&#8217;s still new and trendy!  <a href="https://www.inkshares.com/projects/clockwork-twist-dreamer" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the Twist posting.</p>
<p>Wow!  That was a lot that my stupid blog didn&#8217;t post about.  Well, now you should be all caught up.  And if I missed anything, I&#8217;ll let you know about it all as soon as I remember!  I&#8217;m sorry about for the technical issues.  I hope you&#8217;ve all had a lovely few weeks as well!</p>

<p><a title="wiki link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk" target="_blank">Steampunk</a> is speculative fiction, usually set between 1850 and 1900, and is mostly set in either London or the Old West.  It&#8217;s also sometimes set in a purely fictional world that is full of Victorian era details.  Jules Verne is also aprimary source for many Steampunk enthusiasts.  It&#8217;s both fantasy and Sci-fi, focusing on various occult and magical themes, mixed with misplaced technology and lots of goggles, steam power, airships, and clockwork.<a href="http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;expIds=25657,27342,28203&amp;sugexp=ldymls&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=steampunk&amp;cp=6&amp;wrapid=tljp129445160051608&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=k8MnTdP0KJKisAOc7p2kBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQsAQwAA&amp;biw=1003&amp;bih=448" target="_blank"><span id="more-29"></span></a></p>
<p>For me, Steampunk is a beautiful, exotic, and exciting style to play in.  Electricity was only just beginning to gain importance during the Victorian era, fighting with steam, coal, and analog.  Photography, film, recorded sound, world travel, electric lights, computers, the impressionists, and flight were only just beginning.  At that time in history the future could have been anything.  Add fantasy (faeries, vampires, aliens, time travel, magic,  zombies) to the mix, and of course, airship pirates!  How fun is that?</p>
<p>There are also two other terms you might hear me use on this page:<br />
Victoriana and Neo-Victorian.</p>
<p><a title="wiki link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoriana" target="_blank">Victoriana</a> is anything that was made in the Victorian era (1837 &#8211; 1901), and is indicative of the style of the time period.  For example, the book <a title="Read the book on ibiblio.org" href="http://www.ibiblio.org/julesverne/books/awed%20revd%20edn.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Around the world in 80 Days</em></a> by Jules Vern was written in 1873 and is bursting at the seems with the the flare and feelings of the world at the time.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><a title="wiki link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Victorian" target="_blank">Neo-Victorian</a>, on the other hand, is anything that has been made now but still holds to the styles, values, or aesthetic of the Victorian era.  For example, the fairly recent films <a title="IMDB link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970179/" target="_blank"><em>Hugo</em></a>, and <a title="IMDb link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988045/" target="_blank"><em>Sherlock Holmes</em></a>, or a great deal of the items for sale on <a title="Pretty!!!" href="http://www.etsy.com/search?q=steampunk&amp;view_type=gallery" target="_blank">Etsy</a> are all modern things, which look Victorian.</p>
